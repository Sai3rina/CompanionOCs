10450: Summer vacation is almost over.
To get our minds off that grim
fact, Hayner suggested we go to
the beach.
---
10451: Follow Pence outside!
---
10452: When I got back to the usual spot, I
found a note from Hayner telling us all
to meet at the station. It looked like he
was going to try that beach trip today.
---
10453: Head for the station!
---
10454: The Struggle battle tournament is
taking place at the sandlot today.
---
10455: Hurry to the sandlot!
---
10456: Summer vacation is almost over.
We decide to investigate the seven
wonders of Twilight Town for our
school assignment.
---
10457: Go to the station to catch your train!
---
10458: I showed up at the usual spot, but my
friends didn´t seem to notice I was
there. I couldn´t even touch them.
---
10459: Follow Hayner!
---
10460: Sora and friends awoke in a mysterious
old mansion. They must have been
sleeping for a long time. What´s more,
they had lost all of their memories.
---
10461: Look around outside!
---
10462: We went out into town. Even though
it was Sora´s first visit, the
place seemed strangely familiar
somehow.
---
10463: Go into the golden net!
---
10464: Some kids we met in town said the
King was looking for us.
---
10465: Go to the station to see the King!
---
10466: We successfully reunited with the
King, who told Sora to get on
the train and gave him munny for
tickets.
---
10467: Buy a ticket!
---
10468: The King had been locked away in the
realm of darkness. If he was okay, then
Riku must be, too. We set out on our
journey with hearts full of expectation.
---
10469: Get on the train!
---
10470: We boarded the train and arrived
at a mystical tower.
---
10471: Head for the tower!
---
10472: According to Pete, who was supposed to
have been banished to another dimension,
the tower was home to the King´s
teacher.
---
10473: Climb to the top of the tower!
---
10474: Master Yen Sid, the King´s teacher,
told us Sora was the key that connects
Riku and the journey ahead.
---
10475: Read the book and talk with Yen Sid!
---
10476: Master Yen Sid told us about our new
foes, the Nobodies. We need to change
into some new clothes and prepare
ourselves for battle.
---
10477: Go to the wardrobe!
---
10478: Three good fairies--seamstresses--
were waiting for us in the wardrobe.
---
10479: Talk to the fairies!
---
10480: With Sora's new outfit, we're ready to
be on our way. Seems Master Yen Sid has
a little something for us before we go.
---
10481: Find Master Yen Sid!
---
10482: The worlds have prepared new paths for
us to follow, and we´ll open gates as
we discover the way to go. Our journey
is about to begin...
---
10483: Set sail for the next world!
---
10488: When we arrived in Twilight Town, we
came across Vivi, who was searching
for help. Apparently something was
going on at the sandlot.
---
10489: Hurry to the sandlot!
---
10490: Organization {XIII} backed off and Seifer
was saved, but now Kairi seems to be
caught up in something.
---
10491: Go to the station!
---
10492: The box we´d found in the realm of
darkness contained a photo of the old
mansion in Twilight Town. There´s
something about that mansion...
---
10493: Go to the old mansion!
---
10494: If there are two one-of-a-kind items in
this world, that means there are two
Twilight Towns. Could Kairi be in the
other one?
---
10495: Go inside the old mansion!
---
10496: According to the King, the computer in
the old mansion appears to be connected
to the other Twilight Town.
---
10497: Look for the computer!
---
10498: We found the computer, but it won´t work
without a password. Any ideas as to what
that might be...?
---
10499: Try to remember that ice cream flavor!
---
10500: Entering the password started up the
device, which then shot out a beam of
light. This must be the path to the
other Twilight Town.
---
10501: Touch the beam!
---
10502: We arrived in the other Twilight Town,
the one Roxas lived in. There ought to
be a way into the dark realm here
somewhere.
---
10503: Look for a way into the darkness!
---
10504: The party is once again in Hollow
Bastion. Things are different, but the
Heartless are loose as usual...


---
10505: Take a look around town!


---
10506: Sora and his friends are happy to
see Yuffie. Everyone else is waiting
at Merlin´s house.


---
10507: Head for Merlin´s house!


---
10508: Leon and the gang are trying to rebuild
the town. Sora´s team promises to
help. Leon has something to show.


---
10509: Head for the bailey!


---
10510: Organization {XIII} suddenly appears,
leaving only strange words in their wake.
The Keyblade lights the way to other
worlds.


---
10511: Set sail for the next world!


---
10512: Guided by Merlin, the party returns
to Hollow Bastion. Merlin shows them
the Book of Pooh.


---
10513: Hop inside the book!


---
10514: The Heartless have torn the book´s
pages out, and Pooh´s lost his memory.
Find the torn pages and help him!


---
10515: Collect the torn pages!


---
10516: Thorns have appeared in Disney
Castle. Merlin might know something
about what´s going on.


---
10517: Go see Merlin!


---
10518: Merlin explains how to save Disney
Castle. It´s time for Sora and his
team to act!


---
10519: –––
---
10520: Sora and his friends managed to save
Disney Castle from impending danger.


---
10521: Set sail for the next world!


---
10522: The party´s return to Hollow Bastion is
met by increasing numbers of Heartless
and Nobodies. Time to find Leon.


---
10523: Go to Merlin´s house!


---
10524: Sora and friends learn of a computer
Ansem used. The computer room is
somewhere in the postern.


---
10525: Go to the postern!


---
10526: According to Aerith, the King is with
Leon! Let´s go find that computer
posthaste!


---
10527: Go through the underground corridors!


---
10528: The party reaches Ansem´s study, but
there´s no King and no computer. Leon
arrives.


---
10529: Ask Leon what´s going on!


---
10530: Leon fiddles with the study´s wall and
uncovers a switch that opens the way
to the computer room.


---
10531: Enter the computer room!


---
10532: While Sora and Donald mess with the
computer, a device activates and sends
them to an unknown world.


---
10533: –––
---
10538: Sora´s team returns from the computer
world. To get the research data, they´ll
need Ansem´s password.


---
10539: Look for Ansem´s password!


---
10540: Reunited with the King at last! Using
writing on the study wall, Sora pieces
together the password.


---
10541: Go tell Tron the password!


---
10542: The party returns to the computer
world to keep their promise to
Tron.


---
10543: Go with Tron to the dataspace!


---
10546: Sora and friends return safely to Hollow
Bastion. Thanks to Tron, the DTD data
is now accessible.


---
10547: Use the computer terminal!


---
10548: Sora and his friends are overwhelmed by
the letdowns and surprises they dig out
of the DTD. A tremor rocks the room.


---
10549: See what´s going on outside!


---
10550: Outside, Heartless and Nobodies pour
into the town. Leon and the others in
the borough might be in trouble.


---
10551: Hurry to the borough!


---
10552: Leon and the others stand against
the Heartless and Nobodies. Sora´s
team hurried after the King.


---
10553: Go to the bailey!


---
10554: The great maw of the valley is buried in
the enemy horde. Work together and
bring the battle to an end!


---
10555: Battle your way into the great maw!


---
10556: Organization {XIII}´s goal is to defeat
Heartless with the Keyblade. Speculation
runs wild, but the battle is over for now.


---
10557: –––
---
10558: The battle is over in Hollow Bastion for
now, but how is the town holding up?


---
10559: Onward to Hollow Bastion!


---
10560: Hollow Bastion was supposed to be at
peace, but something´s strange in town.
Better go see Leon.


---
10561: Go to Merlin´s house!


---
10562: The MCP hijacked the computer system
and sent Heartless after Heartless into
the town. Sora´s team decides to go see
Tron.


---
10563: Head for Ansem´s study!


---
10564: The MCP Eradication program is nearly
complete. Leon tells Sora to head for the
I/O tower with Tron and wait there.


---
10565: Access the computer!


---
10566: Tron gives Sora and friends a gift: a
view of the town´s early days. Everyone
remembers the town´s true name.


---
10567: –––
---
10572: The Beast is acting strange when
Sora and his friends stop by the
castle. What could be the matter?


---
10573: Have a look around the castle!


---
10574: Someone´s at the top of the stairs.
Is it Belle? Better talk to her and
find out what´s going on.


---
10575: Belle should be here. Find her!


---
10576: The Beast has locked up the servants
in the dungeon. Head for the west
hall to find the entrance.


---
10577: Head for the west hall!


---
10578: There ought to be a way into the
dungeon somewhere in the west
hall...


---
10579: Look for the basement entrance!


---
10580: The wardrobe in front of the
basement door won´t move. There´s
got to be a way in.


---
10581: Move the wardrobe from the door!


---
10582: The wardrobe is really an enchanted
human, as is the Beast. Rescue the
others before hearing the rest.


---
10583: Head for the dungeon!


---
10584: After defeating the door, the party
finds the transformed servants
locked in the dungeon.


---
10585: Follow the servants!


---
10586: The Beast´s attitude seems to be due
to the Heartless. A secret passage
leads toward his chamber.


---
10587: Use the passage to find the Beast!


---
10588: There´s a trick to that passage!
Light all the lanterns in the passage
to open a hidden door.


---
10589: Work together to light the lanterns!


---
10590: Everyone works together to open
the door and move onward.


---
10591: Head for the Beast´s room!


---
10592: It´s Xaldin from Organization {XIII}!
The Beast is worried about how he
treated Belle earlier.


---
10593: Go with the Beast to see Belle!


---
10594: The Beast goes to Belle´s room, but
she´s not there. She´s off chasing a
mysterious figure.


---
10595: Look for Belle!


---
10596: Moving further into the castle, the
team hears Belle in the ballroom,
calling for help!


---
10597: Hurry to the ballroom and help Belle!


---
10598: The Beast saves Belle and apologizes.
They grow closer, but the spell is far
from broken.


---
10599: –––
---
10600: Sora and friends visit the castle again.
Everything seems okay, but the Beast is
awfully restless.


---
10601: Talk to the Beast!


---
10602: Xaldin interrupts the dance to say he´s
taken something "very dear." The Beast
runs to his chambers.


---
10603: To the Beast´s room!


---
10604: The rose is gone! Along with his only
hope, the Beast has lost his will to
fight. What can be done?


---
10605: Encourage the Beast!


---
10606: Sora and company cheer up the Beast
and go with him in search of his rose.


---
10607: Look for the rose with the Beast!


---
10608: Xaldin was after the Beast in order to
get Kingdom Hearts. Don´t let that fiend
escape!


---
10609: Head outside and go after Xaldin!


---
10610: The rose is returned and the Beast sees
what´s truly dear to him. Will the
spell be broken?


---
10611: –––
---
10612: Sora and his friends arrive a little
outside the Coliseum and spot
Heartless closing in on a woman.


---
10613: Help that woman!


---
10614: Megara was on her way to ask Hades
to give Hercules a break. Sora and his
friends offer to go instead.


---
10615: Go to the Underworld to see Hades!


---
10616: Auron refuses Hades´ demand. Sora,
weakened by the Underworld´s curse,
works with Auron to escape.


---
10617: Escape from the Underworld!


---
10618: Sora and company contain Cerberus
and escape the Underworld, but
where´s Auron? Time to find Meg.


---
10619: Head for the Coliseum to see Meg!


---
10620: While Hercules fetches the Olympus
Stone to negate the Underworld´s
curse, the party trains under Phil.


---
10621: Go see Phil!


---
10622: Phil´s as lively as ever. Looks like
Sora and his friends can start
training whenever they like.


---
10623: Complete your training!


---
10624: Sora and company complete their
training when Hercules returns,
deep in thought.


---
10625: Go talk to Hercules!


---
10626: The Olympus Stone has been stolen--
and Hades has kidnapped Meg. The
party heads for the Underworld.


---
10627: Go to the Underworld to help Meg!


---
10628: Phil was at the entrance to the
Underworld when he was attacked
by someone in black--the Olympus
Stone thief?

---
10629: Follow the black-robed figure!


---
10630: Sora and friends are no match for
the curse´s power. They need the
Olympus Stone, and fast.


---
10631: Keep following that man in black!


---
10632: They defeat a member of Organization
{XIII} and win back the Stone. Safe from
the curse, they go help Meg.


---
10633: Go deeper into the Underworld!


---
10634: Sora and company approach the lock
and open it to find Meg and a door
to...somewhere.


---
10635: Go help Meg!


---
10636: Hercules catches up in time to
rescue Meg. He must be exhausted!
He can´t be left alone like this.


---
10637: Go back and help Herc!


---
10638: Sora and Hercules defeat Pete, but
Hades tosses off a chilling remark
about the Hydra back on the surface.


---
10639: Return to the Coliseum!


---
10640: Something huge and mysterious has
appeared at the entrance to the
Underworld.


---
10641: What´s going on in the Underworld?


---
10642: The Underworld coliseum had appeared
out of nowhere and was hosting all kinds
of battles.


---
10643: Take part in the tournament!


---
10644: Hades announces that the Hades Cup will
be held at the Underdrome. Sora and
Hercules will take part.


---
10645: Take part in the Hades Cup!


---
10646: Hades announces that the Hades Cup will
be held at the Underdrome. Sora and
Hercules will take part.


---
10647: Take part in the Hades Cup!


---
10648: They might fight Auron if they make
it to the finals, but Herc just
doesn´t believe he can do it.


---
10649: Take part in the first round!


---
10650: Even after a successful battle, Hercules
is still down on himself. Next up are the
semifinals.


---
10651: Take part in the semifinals!


---
10652: After the final match-up is decided, the
party sees Auron, but he´s acting strange.
He enters the Underworld.


---
10653: Follow Auron!


---
10654: Auron was being controlled by Hades.
Sora and friends follow Auron out of
the Underworld, wanting to help.


---
10655: Talk to Auron!


---
10656: While Hercules is fighting in the final
round, Sora and company seek out the
statue controlling Auron.


---
10657: Go to the Underworld to get that statue!


---
10658: The statue contained Auron´s free will.
His difficult past made him strong.
Return the statue to Auron.


---
10659: Head for the Underdrome!


---
10660: The party meets Iago, former lackey of
the evil Jafar. He swears he´s changed,
so they take him to the palace.


---
10661: Go to the palace!


---
10662: At the palace, Jasmine is surprised and
upset by Iago´s presence. They go
into town to talk with Aladdin.


---
10663: Go back into town to find Aladdin!


---
10664: Walking into town, they hear a peddler shout
"Stop, thief!" as he chases Abu
and Aladdin. What´s going on?


---
10665: Follow Aladdin!


---
10666: Abu´s swiped a lamp from the peddler.
Aladdin returns it to the man, but it
turns out to have Jafar in it!


---
10667: Go to the shop to get the lamp!


---
10668: Sora and friends try to buy the
lamp off the peddler, but his
asking price is a treasure fit
for a sultan.


---
10669: Talk with Aladdin outside the shop!


---
10670: The price for the lamp is treasure,
but they can´t loot the palace to buy a
measly lamp. Iago suggests finding
treasure in the Cave of Wonders.


---
10671: Leave town for the Cave of Wonders!


---
10672: Sora and company arrived at the Cave of
Wonders, former home of the magic lamp,
in search of treasure.


---
10673: Enter the Cave of Wonders!


---
10674: They disarm the traps set within the
Cave of Wonders and continue onward.


---
10675: Go deeper into the cave!


---
10676: With the party´s trials completed, a
staircase appears before them.


---
10677: Read the sign!


---
10678: They open the door.


---
10679: Go through the door!


---
10680: Sora and friends bring some treasure back
from the Cave of Wonders, but the
shop is empty. What´s going on?


---
10681: See what´s going on outside!


---
10682: Pete is chasing after the peddler,
trying to get the magic lamp. The two
run toward the palace.


---
10683: Follow them to the palace!


---
10684: Sora and company retrieve the magic
lamp, which is sealed away inside the
palace. Iago´s not so bad after all...


---
10685: –––
---
10686: With the lamp sealed away, Agrabah is
peaceful once again. Wonder what
everyone's been up to.


---
10687: Onward to Agrabah!


---
10688: Jafar´s back--the peddler let him out of
the magic lamp! Iago says he´s in the
desert ruins.


---
10689: Follow Iago´s lead!


---
10690: Genie´s magic lets Sora and friends pass
through a sandstorm on their way to the
ruins.


---
10691: Go through the desert to the ruins!


---
10692: The ruins are deserted. It´s a trap! Sora
and company escape and hurry toward
the palace, Jafar´s real target.


---
10693: Hurry to the palace--and Jafar!


---
10694: They defeat the gigantic Jafar, and
Genie restores the battle-scarred town
to its former, peaceful self.


---
10695: –––

Sora meets Mulan, who is pretending
to be a man so she can join the army.


---
10699: Head for camp and join the army!


---
10700: Ping is turned away from the army.
He must complete the Captain´s
assignments as a test of his worth.


---
10701: Complete the Captain´s assignments!


---
10702: Ping works hard on his assignments
and grows ever stronger. He gets a
new assignment from the Captain.


---
10703: Go past the checkpoint to the trail!


---
10704: Ping is allowed to join the army, but
must earn respect. He follows a
suspicious person into a cave.


---
10705: Head for the cave near the village!


---
10706: A swarm of Heartless waited inside
the cave, but Ping and the party
defeated them handily.


---
10707: Tell the captain what happened!


---
10708: Shan-Yu´s army has destroyed both
the village and the troops. The party
heads to the summit to face the Huns.

10710: Ping´s plan defeats Shan-Yu´s army, but
her cover is blown and she´s dismissed.
Sora agrees to accompany her home.

the Imperial City. The Emperor must
be alerted at once!


---
10713: Head for the Imperial City!

10714: Shan-Yu disappears into the palace. The
Heartless in the courtyard are defeated,
but the Emperor´s in danger!


---
10715: Hurry to the palace!


---

worried about the Captain and the Emperor
and go to check on them.

Pooh is safe and sound. Sora is
relieved to see the bear again.


---
10747: Talk to Pooh!


---
10748: The pages the Heartless had torn out
had made Pooh lose his memory. Sora
needs to collect those pages.

the Heartless had torn out.

Eeyore thinks a full stomach might help,
so he leads Pooh to honey.


---
10763: Follow Eeyore!


---
10764: But the honey doesn´t help Pooh
remember a thing. Rabbit says he knows
where to get even more honey.

all by himself.


---
10779: Talk to Kanga and go look for Pooh!

made him a special promise--and

Pooh´s heart forever.

to the hyenas...what´s going on?

the Pride Land´s decline.

white world that strikes the party
as rather nostalgic.

through a strange window to see
Heartless in four different places.

Maleficent angrily scolding someone.


---
10863: Three more groups of Heartless to go!


---
10864: This window showed a door just like the

this same black-and-white world, too.

the past, and that´s where Sora and

Oogie´s headed straight for Christmas
Town.

Town, where they spot smoke rising from

Christmas, but Santa reminds him of his
own important job of Pumpkin King.

he up to these days?


---

decoy presents.

the trap for the thief.

looked around and noticed a disturbance
down at the harbor.


---
10919: Go down the stairs toward the harbor!

they up to? They headed into town looking
for a medallion.

medallions, but if the gold is recovered
and the blood repaid, the curse will be
broken.

10928: Barbossa, leader of the undead pirates,
was once part of Jack´s crew. Jack said
he wants the Black Pearl back.

10929: Head for Isla de Muerta, where the
pirates are!


---
10930: At Isla de Muerta, Sora´s team was told
to watch the boat. But no one´s back yet,
and they´re worried.


---
10931: Go in the cave!


---
10932: The pirates have all the gold back. Now
the blood must be repaid. The ceremony is
about to begin.


---
10933: Proceed to the back of the cave!


---
10934: The blood has been repaid, but the curse
remains... Will saved Elizabeth, and
everyone escaped.


---
10935: Return to Port Royal!


---
10936: On the way back to Port Royal, the truth
came out. Will´s is the blood to be
repaid.


---
10937: Return to Port Royal!


---
10938: Barbossa tracked down the Interceptor,
taking Will and rigging the ship with
gunpowder. It´s gonna blow!

10939: Do something about the powder barrels!


---
10940: Sora´s team somehow survived the crisis.
Now they need to go after Barbossa and
help Will.

there´s more trouble at the harbor.


---
10947: Go see what´s up at the harbor!

fell. Will has gone to Isla de Muerta
alone.

10949: Take the ship to Isla de Muerta!


---
10950: Sora´s team finds Will, and he talks about
a monster Organization {XIII} set loose.
Jack is not keen on chasing it.


---
10951: Get the ship moving away from here!

10952: In the heat of battle, the Interceptor
was sunk and Sora´s team was sent
flying. They washed up at a ship
graveyard.


---
10953: Search the island for a seaworthy ship!


---
10954: Once again Jack is cursed by the
Organization´s monster. Only the stolen
gold the enemy has can stop it now.


---
10955: Collect the gold medallions!


---
10956: Sora´s team collected all the gold. The
Organization must have gone to a place
with lots of people.


---
10957: Head toward Port Royal!


---
10958: The cursed gold was sent to Davy Jones´s
locker, and Port Royal is at peace.


---
10959: –––
---
10960: Sora and friends have been dragged into
the computer system. They decide to
attempt a jailbreak with Tron's help.


---
10961: Open the pit cell door!


---
10962: The party escapes with Tron´s help. To
return to the outside world, they´ll
need the energy core in the canyon.


---
10963: Seek out the canyon´s energy core!


---
10964: Working the energy core in the canyon
will restore power to the terminal
needed to reach the outside world.


---
10965: Seek out the canyon´s energy core!


---
10966: Thanks to Tron, the way home is open.
To get the terminal started, the party
must go back to the pit cell.


---
10967: Return to the pit cell!


---
10968: Tron was asking about the password to
a dataspace called the DTD. Ansem, his
user, had it.


---
10969: Find Ansem´s password!


---
10970: Sora tracked down the password. Now
they head for the DTD dataspace with
Tron.


---
10971: Head for the dataspace!


---
10972: Tron uses the password to unlock the
dataspace, but the MCP counters with a
program that could wreck the town.


---
10973: Hurry to the I/O tower!


---
10974: The hostile program continues to be
transmitted into the town from the I/O
tower.


---
10975: Take on the foes in the tower hallway!


---

will return to the outside world, though
questions about Ansem remain.


---
10977: Return to Hollow Bastion!


---
10978: With a special connection to Tron, the
party returns to the outside world.


---
10979: –––

10980: Tron should be holding off the MCP.
How´s he doing?


---
10981: Onward to Space Paranoids!


---
10982: The party is once again in the computer
world. They´re concerned about Tron,
who´s trapped on the game grid.


---
10983: Warp to the game grid!


---
10984: The MCP plans all-out war with
the Users. Together again with Tron,
the party goes to pick up a program
that can delete the MCP.


---
10985: Head for the I/O tower!


---
10986: The party is almost at the I/O Tower.
Leon´s doing what he can from the
outside world.


---
10987: Hurry into the I/O Tower!


---
10988: The program Leon sent opens up the
solar sailer, which the party can use
to reach the MCP.


---
10989: Use the solar sailer to reach the MCP!


---
10990: Sora´s team gets off the solar sailer at
the MCP´s mesa. The final battle is near.


---
10991: Enter the central computer core!


---
10992: Sora and friends promise they´ll see
Tron again. Tron sends a gift: a view
of the town´s early days.


---
10993: –––
---
10994: With Axel´s help, we made our way out of
the darkness. It seemed Kairi was being
held in the castle dungeon.

---
10997: The Second Day


---

---
11000: The Fifth Day


---
11001: 


---
11002: Guided by a voice calling out to him,
Sora awoke in a mysterious old mansion.
He must have been sleeping there for
a long time, but he couldn´t remember
a thing.


---
11003: Stepping outside, he found the town
strangely familiar, even though he had
never been there before.


---
11004: Sora was wandering around Twilight
Town as puzzled as ever when he met
Hayner, Pence, and Olette in the back
alley. They said they´d seen someone
at the station who was looking for
Sora and his friends. From the sounds
of things, it must be the King.


---
11005: Sora and his friends hurried to the
station, but suddenly found themselves
surrounded by swarms of foes. The
black-clad warrior who rescued them
from their predicament was none other
than the King himself! There was little
time to celebrate their reunion. "You
gotta board the train and leave town!"
said the King, who gave Sora a pouch
of munny before disappearing. But if
the King had been locked away in the
realm of darkness and was safe and sound,
that meant Riku must be, too. Sora made
up his mind to search for Riku: "He and
I can go back to the islands together.
Kairi´s there waiting for us!" Donald
and Goofy agreed to come along too, of
course.


---
11006: It was time for them to set out on
their next journey. Just like the King
said, they had to take a train out of
town; they said good-bye to Hayner and
the others, who had come to the station
to see them off.


---
11007: It was a tearful farewell, even though
Sora had only just met the three
friends... Still feeling strangely sad,
they rode the train to the base of a
lonely tower.


---
11008: Donald and Goofy knew the fellow at
the tower entrance--Pete, who was
never up to any good. The King had
banished him to another dimension, but
the sorceress Maleficent freed Pete,
who served her now. He was gathering an
army of Heartless and had his eye on
making a Heartless out of the King´s
teacher, Master Yen Sid.


---
11009: The tower was overflowing with Heartless.
Master Yen Sid was waiting for Sora and
his friends when they finally made their
way to the top: "Chosen wielder of the
Keyblade! You are the key that will open
the door to light."


---
11010: According to Yen Sid, the light was
under a new threat from the enemies
called "Nobodies." These were the
empty shells left behind when someone
with a strong heart became a Heartless,
yet they had purpose and will they
could act on. A group called Organization
{XIII} was controlling these Nobodies,
although their goals are still unknown.
The King is on a journey to discover
what exactly Organization {XIII} is trying
to accomplish, and if they find the
King, they´ll likely know where Riku
is, too.


---
11011: Sora decided to go out in search of
the King, but needed to change out of
his too-small outfit first.


---
11012: The three good fairies gave Sora
enchanted garments in preparation
for his journey.


---
11013: All that was left was to set sail in
the Gummi ship Master Yen Sid had
prepared. If they opened the gates as
indicated by the beam of light streaming
from the Keyblade, new paths should
appear one after the other, connecting
the worlds once more. Yes, everything
is connected, even hearts that are far
apart and out of reach. A new adventure
awaits!


---
11016: They arrived in Twilight Town again to
find Vivi desperately searching for help.


---
11017: Sora and friends ran to the sandlot and
defeated the Nobodies who were
threatening Seifer and his gang. Saïx,
a member of Organization {XIII}, appeared
to give the group a warning. It seems
Axel had gone AWOL and was aiming to
turn Sora into a Heartless. He then
made a fleeting remark about Riku before
vanishing into the darkness. Seifer
tried to get Sora to accept a trophy
proclaiming him the strongest guy in
town. That´s when a flustered Pence
came by and asked, "You know somebody
named Kairi?"


---
11018: The box found in the realm of darkness
held some ice cream and photos of the
old mansion in Twilight Town.


---
11019: Sora and his friends came by the mansion
searching for clues, only to find Hayner
and his friends recovering after being
attacked by Heartless. Olette said they
thought the old mansion was some kind of
gateway to an alternate Twilight Town.
"What do you mean, alternate?" For
some strange reason, Sora and friends
found they had duplicates of the
handmade pouch and crystals that had
supposedly been one of a kind. This
proved that there was a Twilight Town
"out there" that closely resembled the
one "over here." "That other town must
be where whatever´s missing from here
went!" said Pence. If Kairi had
disappeared from this Twilight Town...
could she be waiting in the other one?
That´s when the King appeared. He was
on the trail of Ansem the Wise, who was
heading for Organization {XIII}´s stronghold.
Though he was pretty vague about it, it
sounded like Sora might be able to meet
up with Riku if he tagged along, too.


---
11020: According to the King, the old mansion´s
computer was connected to the Twilight
Town "over there," where they should
be able to find a way into the realm of darkness.


---
11021: The computer was password-protected,
but Sora and his friends remembered a
likely hint: the ice cream that had been
in the box with the photos of the mansion!


---
11022: Turns out the password was "sea salt
ice cream." Entering the name of
Ansem the Wise´s favorite treat
activated the device, which shot out
a beam of light. The road to the other
Twilight Town had been opened.


---
11023: Sora and his friends arrived in the
other Twilight Town and joined the King
in his search for a way into the dark
realm.


---
11024: Once again we came to Hollow Bastion.
Things were different, but peace
remained as far-off as ever.


---
11025: While wandering through a town still
plagued by Heartless, we were reunited
with Yuffie.


---
11026: "Welcome to the Hollow Bastion Restoration
Committee!" We were led to Merlin´s house
and found Leon and all our old friends
there. Apparently they had all only recently
remembered us. We agreed to help rebuild
the town, but some big obstacles remained.


---
11027: In Villain´s Vale the Heartless were
swarming, as Nobodies darted about.
Sora was ready to take the entire horde
on, but just then Organization {XIII} appeared,
mocking Sora with puzzling words. But
with no time to reflect on this, the
Keyblade shone, opening the way to
another world. Remembering Yen Sid´s
words, we set off once again.


---
11028: Guided by Merlin, we returned to Hollow
Bastion. And what did he have? The Book
of Pooh!


---
11029: But the Heartless tore out the pages,
and Pooh´s memories with them. To
put things back in order, we had no
choice but to find all the torn pages.


---
11030: Thorns had appeared in Disney Castle.
If we didn´t hurry, it would fall to
the darkness.


---
11031: With Merlin´s assistance, we found
out a way to save Disney Castle.


---
11032: Thanks to Sora and his friends,
peace returned to the castle once
more.


---
11033: The Heartless and Nobodies in Hollow
Bastion continued to grow in number.


---
11034: Upon returning to Merlin´s house, we
learned of a computer Ansem used
in his research.


---
11035: What´s more, we found out the King
was with Leon!


---
11036: But when we got to Ansem´s study,
there was no King and no computer.


---
11037: The door to the computer room was
concealed by a hidden switch.


---
11038: Hardly computer savvy, Sora and
Donald pounded on the computer´s keys,
until a strange device activated and
sucked us all into a strange world.


---
11041: The world we found ourselves in was
the computer system itself! With the
help of a security program named Tron,
we got back to the outside world and
began looking for the password to a
dataspace inside the computer. Inside
that dataspace was all of Ansem´s
research data.


---
11042: Back in the outside world, we used
scribbles on a blueprint ("Door to
Darkness") and the King´s own hints
to figure out the password: the names
of the Seven Princesses that were
used to open that very door.


---
11043: We headed back into the computer
world to keep our promise to Tron.


---
11045: We unlocked the dataspace and returned
to Hollow Bastion. Now we could get to
the data inside the DTD.


---
11046: But nearly all the data was corrupted,
and no entries on Riku or Kairi were to
be found. While poking around, we dug
up someone´s portrait. The King said it
was Ansem, but he wasn´t the Ansem we
knew! The Ansem we knew was just the
Heartless of someone who was pretending
to be Ansem, and the Nobody of that same
guy was the leader of Organization {XIII}.
Whew! The King said he was searching for
the real Ansem, who would know who the
fake Ansem was. With all that said,
the room lurched with a loud noise.


---
11047: Outside, the Heartless and Nobodies
were swarming into the town.


---
11048: 


---
11049: Leon and our other friends confronted
the enemy horde. Everyone charged
fearlessly into the sea of foes pouring
from the valley´s great maw.


---
11050: And who showed his face at the end?
Xemnas, leader of Organization {XIII}.
His true identity was Xehanort, pupil
of Ansem the Wise. Sora tried to ask
about Riku and Kairi, but Xemnas told
him to "ask your King" and disappeared
into the darkness. Then Axel appeared,
warning Sora that the Organization
was using him. Lost for answers,
Sora was surrounded by Heartless--
and then a ray of light appeared...
Amidst much speculation, the battle
drew to a tentative close.


---
11051: Hollow Bastion was supposed to be
at peace...


---
11052: But something was wrong.


---
11053: The MCP hijacked the computer system
and sent Heartless after Heartless
into the town.


---
11054: We headed off to see Tron again.


---
11055: The source of the crisis was the
MCP, which hoped to seize power.
After destroying the MCP, we received
a present from Tron. It was a
picture of the town in its early
days. Seeing the old sights brought
back our friends´ memories. When
the name Hollow Bastion came into
use, they did not know--but the
town´s true name was "Radiant
Garden."


---
11058: We stopped by the castle, but the
Beast wasn´t being very friendly. It
seemed all he was interested in was
his precious rose.


---
11059: We asked Belle what was going on.


---
11060: Belle told us the Beast had been
acting strange lately, and had locked
up the servants in the dungeon.


---
11061: We went to the west hall to rescue
the servants and learn more.


---
11062: But a wardrobe was blocking the
door to the basement.


---
11063: When we tried to move the wardrobe,
it talked! It was a human who had
been magically transformed. When
an enchantress turned the young
master, a prince, into a beast
because of his cruelty, she
transformed all of his servants as
well.


---
11064: We defeated the marauding door and
entered the dungeon, where we
found the enchanted servants.


---
11065: Having served the Beast for many
years, they believed Heartless had
caused the change in his demeanor.
We stepped up to the plate at the
first mention of Heartless.


---
11066: The servants showed us to
a secret passage.


---
11067: We opened the hidden door and headed
for the Beast´s room.


---
11068: Inside was Xaldin from Organization
{XIII}, stoking the flames of the Beast´s
anger. Enraged, the Beast set upon
us, but he recovered his senses with
the servants´ help. The Beast worried
that he had done something terrible
to Belle while his mind was not his
own.


---
11069: Wanting to talk to Belle, the Beast
went in search of her, but she was
nowhere to be found.


---
11070: Just then, her voice came from the
ballroom, calling for help!


---
11071: We fought the Heartless that had
come after Belle. She was unharmed,
although Xaldin escaped. The Beast
apologized for his behavior and the
two became closer than ever. Still,
it may be some time before the spell
is broken.


---
11072: We visited the castle again. The Beast
was restless and ill at ease.


---
11073: It was a special day indeed, when he
would enjoy an elegant dance with
Belle. As the dance was beginning,
however, Xaldin appeared and said he
had taken that which the Beast held
"very dear."


---
11074: Xaldin had taken the Beast´s precious
rose. Brokenhearted, the Beast
tried to send Belle and us out of
the castle. The rose was the key
to breaking the spell cast on the
Beast and his servants; it was their
only hope.


---
11075: But there was no time to mope. "Don´t
throw away your last chance,"
encouraged Sora. The Beast found
the strength to fight again.


---
11076: The fearless Xaldin looked down upon
the revitalized Beast. "When Kingdom
Hearts is ours, we can exist fully
and completely."


---
11077: Xaldin tried to kidnap Belle as a way
of trapping the Beast, but she fought
back. We seized that moment to defeat
Xaldin. The rose was returned safely,
and the Beast realized what was truly
dear to him. Their dance began. The
spell will surely be broken any day
now...


---
11078: We arrived a short distance from the
Coliseum and spotted Heartless closing
in on a woman.


---
11079: It turned out to be Hercules´ friend
Megara, who was on her way to ask
Hades to give Herc some time off. We
were worried for her safety, so we
headed for the Underworld in her place.


---
11080: Meanwhile, Hades was trying to make
the warrior Auron, who had been
summoned from the Underworld, go
up against Hercules. Auron refused.
We arrived in time to help Auron
fight Hades, but the curse of the
Underworld sapped our strength.


---
11081: After a bitter struggle, we managed
to contain Cerberus and escape the
Underworld. At the same time, Hades
was looking for a way to use Sora´s
Keyblade to unlock the Underworld´s
coliseum.


---
11082: We met up with Hercules at the Coliseum.
When we told him we wanted to
"teach Hades a thing or two," Herc
offered to get us the Olympus Stone,
which keeps its bearer safe from the
power of the Underworld.


---
11083: While Hercules was away, we trained
hard under Phil´s watchful eye.


---
11084: When Herc returned, it was with a
heavy heart.


---
11085: The Olympus Stone had been stolen by
someone dressed in black. Just then,
Hades arrived to say he´d dragged
Meg down into the Underworld. Herc
wanted to go save her right away, but
he had a match with the Hydra to worry
about.


---
11086: Phil, too, was attacked by someone
in black. We were the only ones who
could unravel this mystery.


---
11087: Still suffering from the Underworld´s
curse, we made our way deeper into
Hades´ lair.


---
11088: We found and defeated a member of
Organization {XIII} and won back the
Olympus Stone.


---
11089: The curse could no longer touch us.
Sora discovered a suspicious lock
deep within the Underworld and
unlocked it with the Keyblade.


---
11090: That´s where Meg was! But why did
Hades look so happy as he left the
scene? Hercules caught up to the
party and distracted the enemy so
we could take Meg back up to the
surface. Meg, however, was worried
about Herc.


---
11091: We went back to lend a hand and take
down Pete, who had been working for
Hades. Hades left the party with
these chilling words: "Maybe you
should go check on that Hydra..."


---
11092: Something huge and mysterious had
appeared at the Underworld entrance.


---
11093: The Underdrome that Zeus had locked
up had apparently been unlocked and
put back in business.


---
11094: All of us, including Hercules, were
forced to participate in the Hades Cup.


---
11095: The Underdrome that Zeus had locked
up had apparently been unlocked and
put back in business. All of us,
including Hercules, were forced to
participate in the Hades Cup, to
be held at the Underdrome.


---
11096: 


---
11097: If we made it all the way to the
finals, we would have to face Auron.
Hercules was still down on himself,
but kept moving up the ranks.


---
11098: The final challengers were decided!
But what was wrong with Auron?
He was acting strange.


---
11099: Hades, the big baddie we´d all been
after, had been controlling Auron
with a magical statue.


---
11100: If we could find that statue, Auron´s
will would be his own again. We headed
for the Underworld as Herc´s clash
with Auron commenced.


---
11101: We finally found the statue, which
contained remnants of Auron´s
difficult past. His heart was
strengthened by the very suffering
he had had to endure.


---
11102: We ran into Iago, former lackey of
our old nemesis, Jafar. He swore
he was a new bird, and so we took
him along to the palace to see
Aladdin.


---
11103: We found Jasmine, who was surprised
and upset to see Iago. She must´ve
suspected he was up to no good.


---
11104: Walking into town, we heard a peddler
shout "Stop, thief!" He was chasing
after Abu and Aladdin.


---
11105: We found Jasmine, who was surprised
and upset to see Iago. She must´ve
suspected he was up to no good.
Walking into town, we heard a peddler
shout "Stop, thief!" He was chasing
after Abu and Aladdin. It looks like
Abu had swiped a lamp from the
peddler. Aladdin returned it to its
rightful owner...but that was the lamp
with Jafar in it!


---
11106: We couldn´t let things stand like that,
so we tried to get the peddler to give
us the lamp. However, his asking price
was a treasure fit for a sultan.


---
11107: We couldn´t let things stand like that,
so we tried to get the peddler to give
us the lamp. However, his asking price
was a treasure fit for a sultan. We
couldn´t just go looting the palace to
buy a measly lamp, though. Iago pointed
out that there might be an appropriate
treasure in the Cave of Wonders.


---
11108: We arrived at the Cave of Wonders,
former home of the magic lamp, in
search of treasure.


---
11109: We disarmed the traps set within
the Cave and moved further in.


---
11110: At long last, a staircase appeared
before us.


---
11111: We opened the door.


---
11112: Just beyond it was a room filled
with treasure! We chose a suitable
prize and returned to Agrabah, but
the peddler´s shop was empty.


---
11113: The peddler was being pursued by
Pete, who wanted the magic lamp.


---
11114: Pete conjured up some Heartless
to nab the lamp, but they were no
match for us. The lamp was sealed
away, deep inside the palace. Maybe
Iago really had gone straight after
all...


---
11115: Things should have been back to
normal in Agrabah...


---
11116: Jafar had returned--the peddler
let him out of the magic lamp! Iago
said he was in the desert ruins.


---
11117: Iago led us to an oasis. A sandstorm
blocked our way, but Genie´s magic
helped us get through and continue
toward the ruins.


---
11118: But Jafar was nowhere to be found.
In fact, Iago had tricked us into
going to the ruins. It was a scheme
of Jafar´s to get them away from
the palace!


---
11119: We rushed back to the palace and put
an end to Jafar´s evil ambitions.
Genie restored the battle-scarred
town, and peace returned once more.


---
11120: 


---
11121: We arrived in a bamboo grove and
spotted what looked like a huge
Heartless nearby. It turned out to
be Mushu, who had journeyed with
us before. Sora met Mulan, and
learned that Mushu is a guardian
dragon for her family. She was
pretending to be a man so she could
join the Imperial Army and face the
Huns.


---
11122: Mulan attempted to join the army
under the name Ping, but she was
turned away. Sora proposed a way
for Ping to prove himself: he must
complete the captain´s assignments
as a test of his worth.


---
11123: Ping worked hard on his assignments
and grew ever stronger.


---
11124: Although Ping was allowed to join the
army, he still wasn´t recognized as
much of a soldier. That´s when Mushu
spotted Shan-Yu walking into a cave.
Ping would be a hero if he could defeat
the mighty Hun leader.


---
11125: We helped Ping search the cave for
Shan-Yu, but he was gone. We cleared
out a swarm of Heartless who had
appeared in the cave instead.


---
11126: When we returned to camp to tell the
captain of Ping´s heroic deed, we
found both the village and the
troops had been decimated by
Shan-Yu´s army.


---
11127: We faced off against the enemy army
at the mountain peak. Ping devised
an ace strategy for defeating both
Shan-Yu and his Heartless hordes,
but she was revealed to be a woman
and expelled from the army.


---
11128: Mulan was ready to give up and go
back home. Then she spotted Shan-Yu,
who she thought had been defeated,
heading for the Imperial City.


---
11129: The Emperor was in real trouble!


---
11130: We arrived just in time to defeat Shan
Yu and keep the Emperor safe. Mulan
was praised by both the Emperor and
the Captain as China´s bravest woman.


---
11131: Peace reigned in the Land of
Dragons...or did it?


---
11132: We stopped by the village again and
spotted someone dressed all in black.


---
11133: Mulan joined us as we pursued the
man to the mountain´s peak.


---
11134: Sora felt something as he came
face to face with the man. Could it
be Riku? He ran away before Sora
could find out.


---
11135: Sora felt something as he came
face to face with the man. Could it
be Riku? He ran away before Sora
could find out. A giant Heartless
showed up instead, and it was
headed for the Imperial City!


---
11136: We ran toward the Imperial City, but
everything was fine. A black-cloaked
man had been spotted nearby.


---
11137: We hurried to the palace.


---
11138: The doors were shut tight, but Mulan´s
quick thinking got us inside, where
we found the man in black...


---
11139: "Riku?" The man revealed his identity
after Sora called out to him. It
was Xigbar from Organization {XIII}.
We held off the enemies Xigbar
sent after us.


---
11140: We went to make sure the Emperor
and the Captain were safe. They
both said they had met a black-cloaked
man earlier--and it wasn´t Xigbar.
Was it Riku? Just then a huge
tremor shook the palace.


---
11141: The giant Heartless we saw on the
summit had arrived. We all worked
together to defeat it and protect
the Imperial City. Mulan´s brave
feats were recognized as she was
asked to serve alongside the Captain.
Sora was confident that Riku was
all right.


---
11142: Sora was back in the Hundred Acre
Wood once again.


---
11143: Pooh was in front of his house,
thinking hard about something
or other.


---
11144: When Sora spoke with Pooh, a strange
force blew him back out of the book,
which was about to be stolen by
Heartless. Sora got it back and went
inside, only to find that Pooh´s
house was all that was left.


---
11145: Sora was relieved to learn that
Pooh was safe and sound.


---
11146: But something was wrong. The pages
the Heartless had torn out had
affected Pooh´s memory. He could
hardly remember a thing.


---
11147: An extra page


---
11148: When Sora arrived with the torn page,
a tree with a tiny door appeared.


---
11149: Sora spotted Piglet being blown
around by the wind.


---
11150: Piglet was finally rescued, but was
so stunned that Pooh had forgotten
him that he was carried off by the
wind yet again.


---
11151: Sora tried to help Piglet, who had
to jump down from a high perch.
This courageous act jogged Pooh´s
memory a little: he remembered
Piglet, but still didn´t recognize Sora.


---
11152: When Sora arrived with the torn
page, a tree surrounded by a garden
appeared.


---
11153: Pooh didn´t remember Eeyore, either.
The donkey suspected Pooh´s memory
would improve with a full stomach, so
he led him to a stash of honey.


---
11154: But the honey didn´t seem to help
Pooh remember a thing. Rabbit,
whose honey Pooh was eating,
thought the bear might need even
more of the sweet and gooey treat.


---
11155: That didn´t help, either. Watching
Rabbit rack his brain, Pooh
remembered both Rabbit and Eeyore,
although Sora was still a stranger
to him.


---
11156: When Sora arrived with the torn
page, a tree full of packages
appeared.


---
11157: Worried about Pooh, Kanga and Roo
brought over some medicine for him,
but Tigger bounced away with it.


---
11158: Tigger suggested that Pooh´s memory
might return if everyone bounced
together.


---
11159: But Pooh´s mind remained as blank
as ever. Seeing the downhearted
Tigger brought back Pooh´s memories
of the rest of his friends. Then, in
a dream, Pooh seemed about to
remember something else...


---
11160: When Sora arrived with the torn
page, a spooky-looking cave appeared.


---
11161: It looked like Pooh had gone into the
cave all by himself.


---
11162: He had been looking for someone
who´d made him a very special
promise. That turned out to be
Sora. Pooh and Sora took each
other´s hand and headed back happy,
surrounded by their friends.


---
11163: When Sora arrived with the torn
page, a hill surrounded by a starry
sky appeared.


---
11164: Pooh had gotten his head stuck in a
honey pot. Silly bear!


---
11165: Pooh was looking for a way to keep
Sora from leaving. "What should I
do so you won´t go far away?" he
asked. Sora pointed to Pooh´s heart
and told him he´ll always be right
there.


---
11166: We arrived in a gorge, only to be
threatened by hyenas. We had to
practice moving around so Sora,
Donald, and Goofy could get used to
their new jungle "attire."


---
11167: Then they met Nala, a lioness cornered
by Heartless. She told us about the sad
state of her homeland, and Sora agreed
to help make things right.


---
11168: But according to the shaman, Rafiki,
whoever saved the Pride Lands would
be king. Sora just wasn't qualified.


---
11169: As we started to leave the Pride
Lands, we were surrounded by King
Scar and his hyena henchmen, but
Nala helped us escape. When Sora
asked her if there was anyone else
who could be king, she muttered, "If
only Simba were here..."


---
11170: Simba had fought alongside Sora a
year earlier. Nala was thrilled to
hear this news!


---
11171: Scar had told Nala that Simba had
died along with Mufasa, their last king.
Just then, Rafiki appeared and pointed
toward the oasis.


---
11172: That´s where Simba was.


---
11173: Nala asked him to come back to the
Pride Lands, but Simba declined,
saying it was better to forget the
past and live for today--"hakuna
matata."


---
11174: Simba had been blaming himself for
his father´s death when he saw a
vision of his father, who gave him
the courage to return to the Pride
Lands.


---
11175: Simba challenged Scar to a fight,
during which he learned the truth:
Scar had killed his father Mufasa.
Simba roared with anger!


---
11176: Simba defeated Scar and let out a
roar of triumph from the Pride Rock
overlook. The lionesses responded to
his call as their new king ascended
to his throne.


---
11177: Simba is king of the Pride Lands.


---
11178: 


---
11179: We met up with the hyenas on the
savannah. They could only laugh at
the very mention of Simba, the new
king. Thinking this was strange, we
set off to see Simba when Scar´s
ghost appeared.


---
11180: Although this may have been a sign
that the kingdom was in decline,
Simba seemed unwilling to take any
action. His choice caused great
unease among his subjects.


---
11181: But Simba had a reason for his inability
to act--he was tied up in thinking
"What would my father have done?"
We helped him realize that his own
decisions were more important, and
Simba regained his confidence as a
leader.


---
11182: According to Rafiki, Scar´s ghost
was a manifestation of Simba´s
weakness.


---
11183: Empty
---
11184: We headed for the elephant graveyard
to learn just what the mystic mandrill
meant by these words. We asked the
hyenas about Scar´s ghost, who
suddenly reappeared. Simba ran away.


---
11185: We gave Simba some much-needed
encouragement, and he in turn
realized how his many friends
were there for him. Simba defeated
Scar´s ghost at last.


---
11186: Simba rescued Nala from the hands
of a giant Heartless, and peace
reigned over the Pride Lands once
again.


---
11187: Sora and friends paid a visit to
Atlantica, the kingdom under the sea,
and got to see Ariel again.


---
11188: Everyone was gearing up for a big
musical, but Ariel just couldn´t stay
focused on rehearsals. Sebastian
asked Sora, Donald, and Goofy to
perform, but even then Ariel´s mind
seemed to be somewhere else.


---
11189: It turned out she was curious about
the human world. Flounder suggested
showing her a statue he found,
thinking it would cheer her up, since
Ariel loves things from the surface.


---
11190: Ariel was spellbound by Flounder´s
gift. It turned out to be a statue
of the man she´d had her eyes on.


---
11191: Ariel was in love with a human prince.


---
11192: But he lived in the human world,
and Ariel would have to become a
human to be with him. Ursula
convinced her to trade her voice
for a chance to do so.


---
11193: Ariel and Eric had a lovely time
together...but Ursula had other plans.
Sora stopped her from using Ariel´s
voice to steal Eric away, but King
Triton was transformed when trying
to stand up for his daughter.
Thankfully, Eric came to the rescue!
He joined forces with Sora and his
friends, and they defeated the sea
witch.


---
11194: Eric learned that Ariel is a mermaid,
but that didn´t change his feelings
for her. They were meant to be
together. Sebastian´s musical was
a big hit, with Sora, Donald, and
Goofy playing major roles. Thus land
and sea came together as one.


---
11195: We stopped by Disney Castle, but
something wasn´t quite right.


---
11196: Heartless had appeared in the peaceful
castle. We got the specifics from
Queen Minnie, then split up to get
to the bottom of things.


---
11197: Sora and Queen Minnie headed for
the audience chamber, mowing down
Heartless along the way.


---
11198: The reason for the crisis was revealed
in the Hall of the Cornerstone,
hidden beneath the throne. The
Cornerstone of Light that kept the
castle peaceful was being overgrown
by thorns. This was Maleficent´s
doing!


---
11199: We took Queen Minnie´s advice and
headed for Hollow Bastion. Merlin
created a mysterious door for us.
He said we could restore the castle
by closing another door beyond this
one.


---
11200: We stepped into the world beyond
the mysterious door, where we
came face to face with a rather
nostalgic black-and-white world.


---
11201: We made our way through Merlin´s
door and into a black-and-white
world on a quest to save the castle.


---
11202: We ran into Pete, but he was like a
completely different person. Maybe
he wasn´t the one who fooled with
the castle. While searching for
another mysterious door, we
discovered a suspicious window.
We tugged on the pull cord and saw
what had happened in this world
moments before we arrived.


---
11203: We knocked on another window and
saw Maleficent angrily scolding...
someone.


---
11204: Yet another window showed a door
identical to the one Merlin had made.
It must lead to the same black-and-
white world.


---
11205: Finally we learned the truth: these
mysterious doors were connected to
the past--and that´s exactly where
we were.


---
11206: The final window showed Pete not
as he was when we first met him
in this world, but as old Pete the
villain.


---
11207: We brought Pete´s boat to a halt
and kept the Cornerstone of Light
safe from harm.


---
11208: Sora´s Keyblade sealed the door
shut, so Pete wouldn´t be able to
come back to the past. The
Cornerstone of Light was returned
to its rightful home, banishing
darkness from the castle for good.


---
11209: We stopped by Halloween Town, puzzled
by its new appearance.


---
11210: 


---
11211: Obsessed with Christmas, Jack had
decorated the town in the hopes of
handling the holiday himself this
year. Unaware of Sally´s feeling of
dread, Jack set off to see Santa
Claus.


---
11212: Just then, Heartless appeared in
town. "How is Santa supposed to
relax with all this going on?" Jack
fretted, and asked us to be Santa´s
bodyguards.


---
11213: Santa lived in Christmas Town, where
a colorful scene unfolded before us
as we walked through the gates.


---
11214: But there were Heartless here, too.
We fought as one and made our way
to Santa´s house.


---
11215: We were happy to see that Santa
was safe and sound when a loud
noise came from a back room.


---
11216: 


---
11217: Lock, Shock, and Barrel were spotted
running out of the toy workshop.


---
11218:  


---
11219: We followed the trio´s footprints
back to Halloween Town and found
the three pranksters, who said
Oogie had returned--just before
running away. It was then that
the party learned that Maleficent
had brought Oogie back to life!
Sally´s intuition had been right on.
The newly revived Oogie kidnapped
Santa!


---
11220: We hurried back to Christmas Town
in pursuit of Oogie.


---
11221: Oogie was trying to take over the
toy workshop, but we defeated him
handily. With that taken care of,
Jack told Santa that he´d like to
deliver the presents this time.
Santa reminded Jack that he had
his own special role to play, so
Jack returned to his post as the
Pumpkin King.


---
11223: Christmas was right around the corner.


---
11224: 


---
11225: We stopped by Halloween Town and
found presents scattered all over the
place. We returned them to Santa,
who said they had been stolen. We
were about to set out with Jack to
find the culprit when we heard a
noise come from the toy workshop.


---
11226: 


---
11227: We went into the workshop, where
we found Lock, Shock, and Barrel,
who said they were only looking for
parts for the doctor´s experiment.
Sally arrived and said Heartless had
appeared in the town square. Could
they have been responsible?


---
11228: 


---
11229: The Heartless didn´t steal any presents.
And now the doctor´s experiment had
been stolen, too. Who on earth could
the thief be? We would have to lure
them in somehow. We borrowed Santa´s
workshop to make decoy presents.


---
11230: We used these presents to set a
trap for the thief.


---
11231: When we arrived at Port Royal, there
was some kind of disturbance down at
the harbor.


---
11232: There we found Pete and a crew of
undead pirates. They said something
about a medallion and headed into
town.


---
11233: We followed them just in time to see
the governor´s daughter Elizabeth
get kidnapped by the pirates. We
went after them along with a young
man named Will.


---
11234: But the pirates had already set sail.
We managed to persuade Jack Sparrow,
a lone pirate we met at the harbor,
to take the Royal Navy´s Interceptor
and go after the pirates´ ship, the
Black Pearl.


---
11235: Meanwhile Barbossa was divulging
his secret: because they stole
certain Aztec medallions, he and his
crew were put under a horrible
curse. To break the curse, all the
medallions must be restored to
their chest and the blood repaid...


---
11236: 


---
11237: 


---
11238: It turned out the Black Pearl was
Jack´s boat, which Barbossa had
stolen. The reason Jack helped us
was so he could get his boat back.
With compass in hand, Jack guided
the Interceptor across the seas...
We arrived at Isla de Muerta, the
resting place for the cursed gold.
We were told to watch the boat
while Will and Jack set off to rescue
Elizabeth, but when no one returned,
we started to worry. Inside the
island cave, the raucous pirates
stood before all the medallions they
had finally tracked down. Now the
blood could be repaid, and the curse
broken...


---
11239: ...except that Elizabeth´s blood had
no effect at all. While the pirates
bickered over their plight, Will
escaped with Elizabeth.


---
11240: 


---
11241: The truth came to light on the way
back to Port Royal. The key to
breaking the curse wasn´t Elizabeth´s
blood, but that of Will´s father--
the blood of a pirate. The blood to
be repaid ran in Will´s veins. The
scheming Barbossa tracked down the
Interceptor, kidnapping Will and
rigging the ship with gunpowder.


---
11242: All of us, including Jack, were in a
real pinch, but together we overcame
the crisis and set off to rescue Will.


---
11243: Our battle with Barbossa ended in
victory, and thanks to Jack himself
being cursed, no less! Will and
Elizabeth were elated to be together
again, and Jack set sail on the Pearl
once more.


---
11244: The town looked peaceful--but
was it?


---
11245: Our return to Port Royal was once
again met with some sort of fuss
down at the harbor.


---
11246: The curse was supposed to be lifted,
but sure enough, undead pirates
were the source of the ruckus.
With Jack´s help we put them in
line, and then Elizabeth showed
up. Will, thinking the medallions
might be the source of the problem,
set off for Isla de Muerta.


---
11247: We went out to sea per Elizabeth´s
wishes, and found Will drifting on a
shipwreck. He said Organization {XIII}
took the medallions.


---
11248: Jack wanted nothing to do with it,
but then a member of the Organization
showed up. He invoked "parley" from
the Pirates´ Code and made off with
several of the gold medallions. In
all the fuss we were attacked by a
monster, and the Interceptor was sunk.


---
11249: We washed up in a ship graveyard.
For some reason, Jack alone had
fallen under the monster´s curse.


---
11250: "They´re making pirates look like
proper gents," said Jack, as we set
off after the Organization and the
gold. The final battle was to be in
Port Royal.


---
11251: We defeated the monster and removed
Jack´s curse. The Organization got
away, but Port Royal would be at
peace once the Aztec gold was at the
bottom of the sea. The legendary
pirate Jack Sparrow set off on the
Black Pearl for another adventure.


---
11252: When we fiddled with Ansem´s computer,
the MCP sucked us into the computer
system. Caught by Commander Sark,
we were sent to a pit cell, where we
met Tron, a security program.


---
11253: With Tron´s help, we broke out of
the cell and headed for the energy
core in the canyon.


---
11254: We needed it to restore power to
the terminal leading back to the
outside world.


---
11255: With everything for our return
journey in order, Tron asked us a
favor.


---
11256: To gain access to the dataspace
known as the DTD, we needed to find
Tron´s User and ask him the password.
And the User? None other than Ansem.


---
11257: Back in the outside world, we used
scribbles on a blueprint ("Door to
Darkness") and the King´s own hints
to figure out the password: the names
of the Seven Princesses that were
used to open that very door.


---
11258: Tron tried the password right away,
unlocking the dataspace, but the
MCP sent a hostile program,
putting the town itself in danger.


---
11259: We hurried to the I/O tower, but
the program remained undisrupted.


---
11260: By destroying the hostile program,
we were able to save the town.


---
11261: After the battle, Tron told us more
about Ansem. Both Tron and the MCP
were improved by Ansem, but why
would the same person restore two
opposing programs? The mysteries
remained, but we figured we´d find
the answer eventually. Having gained
a special connection to Tron, we
returned to the outside world.


---
11262: Things should have calmed down in
the computer world...


---
11263: The town was facing a crisis because
of the MCP, so we headed back into
the computer world.


---
11264: It seemed the MCP was ready to wage
all-out war against the Users. Reunited
with Tron, we went to download a
program designed to destroy the MCP
for good.


---
11265: Leon was doing his part in the outside
world, too.


---
11266: At the I/O tower, we downloaded
the program, powering up Tron and
getting us access to a solar sailer
in the process.


---
11267: The final battle was at hand...
We boarded the solar sailer and
headed for the MCP´s mesa.


---
11268: We defeated Sark, and thwarted the
MCP´s plans to conquer all. We made
a promise with Tron to meet again
and parted ways. Tron used his control
of the system to send us a gift: a
view of the town in its early days.


---
11269: Axel used the last of his strength
to help us escape the darkness. We
then found ourselves in a town bathed
in eerie moonlight. It seemed Kairi
was being held in the dungeon of this
town´s castle.

MCP
---
11446: MCP Runs Amok
---
11447: The MCP churned out Heartless to
invade the real-life town
---
11448: The Solar Sailer
---
11449: Sora and friends ride the solar sailer
toward the MCP´s central computer core
---
11450: MCP Face-Off
---
11451: Sora and friends have a showdown
with the MCP
---
11452: Farewell, Tron
---
11453: Tron bids his new friends farewell
---
11454: Sora
---
11455: A boy chosen by the Keyblade,
a mysterious weapon.

Not long ago, Sora journeyed
with Donald and Goofy in search
of his longtime friend Kairi,
who had been spirited away
into the darkness.

In the end, they saved the world
of all worlds from the darkness
that was closing in.

After that, Sora continued
journeying in search of Riku,
his best friend who was trapped
on the other side of the door
to darkness. And somewhere
along the way, Sora fell into a
deep slumber.

With a new outfit and
strengthened resolve, Sora has
set out once more on a search
for his friend Riku.
---
11456: Donald Duck
---
11457: The Royal Court Magician.

Not long ago, Donald left Disney
Castle with Goofy to search for
King Mickey. During that quest,
they met Sora and became fast
friends.

After they helped Sora save the
worlds from darkness, Donald
and Goofy continued their search
for King Mickey, who had decided
to stay behind in the realm of
darkness.

But before they could find the
King, the three friends were
plunged into a deep sleep.
---
11458: Goofy
---
11459: Captain of the Royal Knights.

Not long ago, Goofy left Disney
Castle with Donald in search of
King Mickey. Along the way, they
joined Sora, obeying the King's
command to "follow the Keybearer."

After helping save the worlds
from darkness, Goofy continued
his quest to find the King.
But like Donald and Sora, he
fell into a deep slumber before
he could finish the quest. Wonder
what Goofy was doing just before
he fell asleep.
---
11460: Kairi
---
11461: Longtime friend of Riku and Sora,
and one of the Seven Princesses
with ties to the Keys and Keyholes.
Not long ago, when she was lost in
the darkness, Riku and Sora both
tried to save her, each in his own
way.

Thanks to them, Kairi was able to
return to her home islands, but her
memories of Sora were gone, and she
soon stopped visiting the islet
where they once played.
---
11462: Ansem
---
11463: Mysterious wielder of darkness.

What could his true purpose be?
---
11464: Riku
---
11465: The form Sora´s longtime friend
Riku chose.

Though Xehanort tried to control
Riku from within, Riku´s heart
proved stronger. But the only
way to wield the darkness fully
was to become it.

Riku began calling himself
"Ansem," perhaps as a sign of
resolve. He would live in darkness
if that´s what it took to wake
Sora.
---
11466: DiZ
---
11467: An entity shrouded in mystery.
---
11468: Ansem
---
11469: 
---
11472: Organization {XIII}
---
11473: Organization {XIII}´s Number {I}.
He directs the group as its
leader.

Organization {XIII} is a unique
presence among the Nobodies.
They think and plan, and seem
to have a greater goal.

What that is remains to be
seen, but they appear to know
a bit about the Keyblade.
---
11474: Organization {XIII}
---
11475: Organization {XIII}´s Number {II}.
Nothing else about him has come
to light.

He vanished, leaving Sora with
naught but puzzling words.
Apparently Organization members
can use the darkness to come and
go as they please.
---
11476: Organization {XIII}
---
11477: Organization {XIII}´s Number {III}.

Nobodies like him are made
whenever people strong of heart
and mind become Heartless. The
empty shell they leave behind
acts of its own will.

Are they empty vessels devoid
of hearts? Are they roaming
spirits? Or are they simply
nothing at all?
---
11478: Vexen
---
11479: Formerly Organization {XIII}´s
Number {IV}. He has been
eliminated.

Vexen, Lexaeus, and Zexion
were among Organization {XIII}´s
founding members, and there
was no love lost between them
and neophytes like Marluxia.
Vexen opposed Marluxia´s plans
to take over the Organization,
and was consequently destroyed
by Axel.
---
11480: Lexaeus
---
11481: Formerly Organization {XIII}´s
Number {V}. He once brandished a
giant tomahawk, but now he has
been eliminated.

Lexaeus rejected Marluxia´s bid
to dominate the Organization,
and formulated his own plans--
but the plans failed and he met
his end.
---
11482: Zexion
---
11483: Formerly Organization {XIII}´s
Number {VI}. He has been
eliminated.

Zexion disliked dirtying his own
hands, and relied on his wits to
dispose of any rivals--but it was
one of his own schemes that wound
up destroying him.
---
11484: Organization {XIII}
---
11485: Organization {XIII}´s Number {VII}.

Nobodies like him may look like
they respond emotionally, but this
is, in fact, a ruse. Nobodies have
no hearts.
---
11486: Axel
---
11487: Organization {XIII}´s Number {VIII}.
He commands fire and carries a
uniquely shaped weapon.

He has proven to be an odd duck
of sorts within the Organization,
lashing out against treachery,
yet stirring trouble with his
own betrayals all the while.

He claims he and Sora share some
sort of bond, but Sora can´t
imagine what that might be.
---
11488: Organization {XIII}
---
11489: Organization {XIII}´s Number {IX}.

Organization members all wear
black coats, and it´s said their
numbers were assigned in the
order they joined. In addition,
their names share something as
a mark of their brotherhood.
---
11490: Organization {XIII}
---
11491: Organization {XIII}´s Number {X}.

The Organization has hinted that
not only do they know about the
Keyblade, but they may know
things about Sora himself. Are
they playing mind games, or is
there truth to their words?
---
11492: Marluxia
---
11493: Formerly Organization {XIII}´s
Number {XI}. He has been
eliminated.

He plotted an Organization
rebellion and tried to seize the
power of the Keyblade, but Axel´s
betrayal led to his destruction.
---
11494: Larxene
---
11495: Formerly Organization {XIII}´s
Number {XII}. She has been
eliminated.

Larxene conspired with Marluxia
to turn on the Organization.

Larxene was unfeeling and loved
nothing more than to bring
other people down, but she met
her demise when that malice came
full circle.
---
11496: Roxas
---
11497: Organization {XIII}´s Number {XIII},
a Keyblade wielder and denizen
of darkness.

He vanished with a satisfied
look after battling Sora--
but Sora was the only one who
could see him in the first place.
---
11498: Selphie
---
11499: A girl who lived on the same
islands as Sora. She always
played with Sora and the other
boys.

Selphie´s whereabouts were in
question after Destiny Islands
vanished some time ago, but thanks
to Sora´s help, she was able to
return home.
---
11500: Stitch
---
11501: A strange visitor from a distant
planet.

Stitch is very strong for his
small size and prone to mischief. 

He´s always ready to help his friend
Sora whenever Sora needs him.
---
11502: Genie
---
11503: 
---
11504: Peter Pan
---
11505: The boy who can fly. He´s from
Never Land, where children
never grow up.

Not long ago, Peter helped Sora and
the others defeat the Heartless.

During this new adventure, Peter
and his friend Tinker Bell help
Sora out once again.
---
11506: Chicken Little
---
11507: Chicken Little has more pluck and
heart than most boys twice his
size. He never turns away from
a challenge, no matter how big
it is.

He´s a loyal pal of Sora´s, and
is always quick to answer a call
for help.
---
11512: Pete
---
11513: A tough and mean former
steamboat captain. Donald and
Goofy know Pete real well--
he´s so bad that King Mickey
was forced to banish him to
another dimension.

Maleficent found Pete there
and helped him escape from
exile. Since then, he´s
been traveling the worlds,
assembling an army of
Heartless for Maleficent.
It´s pretty certain that the
two of them are planning to
take over and rule all the
worlds.
---
11514: Maleficent
---
11515: A sorceress of frightening power.
In the last adventure, she
controlled the Heartless and led
a group that was trying to
harness the power of darkness.
As part of her villainous plan,
Maleficent tricked Riku into
making the choice to dive into
the realm of darkness.

In the end, Maleficent yielded
to the power of darkness herself
and was defeated by Sora and
his friends. But by using her last
bit of evil power, she was able
to come back again some time later.
---
11516: Pluto
---
11517: The King´s faithful dog. But
Pluto´s more than a pet. He
and King Mickey are bound
together by the strongest ties
there are: friendship and loyalty.
When the King disappeared, Pluto
set out with the others to find
his master.

I hope that famous nose of his
will lead him to the King.
---
11518: Jiminy Cricket
---
11519: Glad you could join us! Cricket´s
the name--Jiminy Cricket. Queen
Minnie asked me to come along
on this quest as the Royal
Chronicler. And what an adventure
it´s been!

You might remember that I also
help my pal Pinocchio out as his
official conscience. I try to keep
the little fellow on the straight
and narrow and show him right
from wrong. He sure can be a
handful sometimes.
---
11520: King Mickey
---
11521: The king of Disney Castle. It´s
been a while since he set off
alone to fight the darkness
threatening the worlds.

King Mickey and Riku stayed
behind in the realm of darkness
to keep the Heartless from
escaping again.

Donald, Goofy, and Sora will
keep searching until they´re
reunited with the King.
---
11522: King Mickey
---
11523: The king of Disney Castle. He was
the first to realize what a threat
the darkness was, and the first
to act. King Mickey travels across
the worlds, battling the Heartless
and searching for an answer to the
riddle of Organization {XIII} and the
Nobodies.

After many great battles, the King
seems even more determined than
ever to fight against the darkness.
---
11526: Sora
---
11527: The boy chosen by the Keyblade,
truly the "key" to everything.

The magic of Merryweather and
her fairy friends has prepared
new clothes for Sora.

These garments appear to come
complete with various abilities,
such as the power of
transformation.

With renewed resolve, Sora sets
out for adventure once more.
---
11528: Donald Duck
---
11529: The Royal Court Magician.

Like Sora, Donald had fallen into
a deep slumber, but woke up
moments before Sora did.

They´re happy to be reunited
after all this time...but what
lies ahead?
---
11530: Goofy
---
11531: Captain of the Royal Knights.

Like Sora, Goofy had fallen into
a deep slumber. He doesn´t
remember why he was asleep, but
he´s thoroughly refreshed after
sleeping so well.

Who can say what´s in store for
our three reunited friends?
---
11532: Roxas
---
11533: A boy who lived in Twilight Town
and saw Sora´s memories in
dreams.

His summer vacation has come to
an end, and many of his thoughts
and feelings with it.
---
11536: Naminé
---
11537: A girl with the power to
manipulate memories.

She seems to have some strong
connection to Sora.
---
11538: Hayner
---
11539: A boy who lives in Twilight Town
who has a bit of an attitude
problem. Once he gets an idea,
he has to LIVE it--and Pence and
Olette get dragged along for the
ride.

There´s bad blood between Hayner
and Seifer--the town´s self-
appointed "disciplinarian."
---
11540: Pence
---
11541: A boy who lives in Twilight Town.
He hangs out with Hayner (their
"leader") and Olette (the
responsible one).

As for Pence himself, he´s
relatively laid back. When there´s
a problem, he takes his time and
approaches the problem
realistically.

He likes spending time with his
friends--especially when there´s
sea salt ice cream.
---
11542: Olette
---
11543: A girl who lives in Twilight Town.
She spends most of her time with
Hayner and Pence.

Olette makes sure to look after
the two of them, and won´t stand
for unfinished homework.

She likes to go shopping on Market
Street and watch the sunset while
talking with her friends.
---
11544: Seifer
---
11545: Self-appointed head of the
"Twilight Disciplinary Committee."

Seifer does his best to keep the
town up to his own rigorous
standards, but not everyone
appreciates his high-handed
tactics--take Hayner´s gang, for
example.

His followers Fujin and Raijin are
never far away.
---
11546: Rai (Raijin)
---
11547: One of Seifer´s followers...
y´know?

Rai tends to get carried away--and
truth be told, he feels like he can´t
hold a candle to Fuu.
---
11548: Fuu (Fujin)
---
11549: One of Seifer´s followers. She
never says a word more than she
has to, leading to some very unusual
"one-worders."

Fuu has Seifer´s complete trust,
and sees her mission in life as
making herself useful to him.
---
11550: Setzer
---
11551: A wayfaring gambler who´s ready
for any game and any challenge.
He´d even cast his life to the
chips and let luck choose its
course.

Setzer is the Struggle´s prior
winner. He tends to be followed
by an army of lovestruck, screaming
girls.
---
11552: Vivi
---
11553: A boy who lives in Twilight Town.
It´s not so much that he follows
Seifer. But he´s so meek he does
whatever he´s told anyway, and
usually gets stuck with the chores.

In spite of all that, Vivi likes
Seifer and admires his strength.
---
11554: Yen Sid
---
11555: A powerful sorcerer, second to none.
He tutored the King in magic.

From conjuring up skies full of
beautiful butterflies to parting an
ocean, Yen Sid´s feats of wizardry
are...well, amazing. His name alone
fills some folks with awe.

Yen Sid shared some of his wisdom
with Sora and his friends. He also
taught them some valuable techniques
to help prepare them for what
they´ll face on this new quest.
---
11556: Flora
---
11557: A kind and good fairy, Flora is
always dressed in red. The leader
of the group, she helps Fauna and
Merryweather make the right
decisions.

Flora helped Sora prepare for his
journey with just the right
traveling clothes.
---
11558: Fauna
---
11559: A sweet and gentle fairy, Fauna
dresses in green. Always eager to
please, she only uses magic to help
others.

Fauna helped Sora prepare for his
journey with just the right
traveling clothes.
---
11560: Merryweather
---
11561: A spirited fairy dressed in blue,
Merryweather can sometimes be a bit
stubborn. Together with Fauna and
Flora, she tries to stop Maleficent
from harming others.

Merryweather helped Sora prepare
for his journey with just the
right traveling clothes.
---
11562: Sora
---
11563: The chosen hero of the Keyblade.
He´s looking for his friend Riku
so they can return to their
island home together.

Not long ago, Sora waged a great
battle here against Maleficent,
whose Heartless filled the castle
corridors.
---
11564: Donald Duck
---
11565: The Royal Court Magician. He´s
traveling the worlds with Sora
and Goofy in search of King Mickey,
who´s battling the forces of
darkness.

Not long ago, Donald helped fight a
great battle here against
Maleficent, whose Heartless
filled the castle corridors.
---
11566: Goofy
---
11567: Captain of the Royal Knights.
He´s traveling the worlds with
Sora and Donald in search of
King Mickey, who´s battling
the forces of darkness.

Not long ago, Goofy helped fight
a great battle here against
Maleficent, whose Heartless
filled the castle corridors.
---
11568: Scrooge McDuck
---
11569: Donald´s uncle. Before the
Heartless appeared, he was
using the Gummi Ship to travel
across the worlds, setting
up a big business empire.
Scrooge has more money than
most folks can count. But for
some reason, he´s pretty
stingy about spending it.

Nowadays Scrooge is working on
an ice cream venture he hopes
will make him millions.
---
11570: Huey
---
11571: One of Donald´s three nephews,
Huey is the leader of the bunch.
He keeps Dewey´s plans in line
and makes sure Louie doesn´t
fall behind while they help out
with Uncle Scrooge´s ice cream
business. You can spot him by his
trademark red cap.

The last time we saw Huey, he
was working in Traverse Town,
saving up for an expedition.
---
11572: Dewey
---
11573: One of Donald´s three nephews
who´s helping out with Uncle
Scrooge´s ice cream business.
Dewey always wears a blue cap.
He´s smart and cheerful and
likes to come up with plans to
have fun.

The last time we saw Dewey,
he was working in Traverse
Town, saving up for an
expedition.
---
11574: Louie
---
11575: One of Donald´s three nephews
helping out with Uncle
Scrooge´s ice cream business.
Louie is gentle and carefree, but
notices a lot of things others
miss. To find him, look for his
green cap.

The last time we saw Louie,
he was working in Traverse
Town, saving up for an
expedition.
---
11576: Merlin
---
11577: A powerful wizard who´s currently
living in Hollow Bastion. He´s
letting the Hollow Bastion
Restoration Committee use his
house as a meeting place.

Merlin has wisdom and magical
powers that are second to none,
and he taught Donald most of
what he knows about magic. He
also has a mysterious bag that
can hold anything, no matter how
big it is.
---
11578: Leon
---
11579: A swordsman who carries a
gunblade. His real name is Squall
Leonhart. He took the name Leon
to distance himself from his
past self--the man who stood
helpless as Heartless invaded
his home.

For some time he took refuge in
a different town, but thanks in
part to Sora´s help, Leon was
able to reclaim this, his
hometown. Now he works tirelessly
towards its restoration.
---
11580: Cid
---
11581: An engineer, tech wizard, and
first-rate pilot. He met Sora
as a castaway while he was
running a shop away from his
hometown.

Now that he's back home, Cid is
an active member of the town's
Restoration Committee.
---
11582: Cloud
---
11583: A "SOLDIER" who effortlessly
wields a hefty sword. He once
fought against Sora and his
friends while under contract
with Hades.

Cloud hates letting other people
see what he´s thinking, so he
can be an enigma to other people.

He searches for Sephiroth,
hoping to settle things once and
for all with his inner darkness.
---
11584: Aerith
---
11585: A young woman whose quiet eyes
belie an unbreakable will.
Like Leon, she met Sora while
living away from her hometown,
and helped him now and then on
his journey.

Now Aerith works with Leon and
Yuffie to restore the town to
its past splendor.
---
11586: Tifa
---
11587: A young woman in search of a
certain someone.

Unflinching, unrelenting, Tifa
has looked far and wide.

Her journey won´t be over until
she finds the person she seeks.
---
11588: Yuffie
---
11589: One member of the town´s
Restoration Committee, a
spirited girl who actively does
her part to keep tabs on the
town.

Yuffie met Sora when she was
living away from her hometown.
Thanks to his help last time,
the Heartless were ousted and
she got to come home--so she´s
very grateful to him.
---
11590: Sephiroth
---
11591: An unsurpassed swordsman
who was once revered as a
hero.

For a long time, Sephiroth's
whereabouts were unknown,
and no one can say for sure
why he has returned.

He seems to have some
connection to Cloud's past.
---
11592: Yuna
---
11593: One of a teenybopping trio
of friendly neighborhood
something-or-others.

They were looking for Leon,
but...why?
---
11594: Rikku
---
11595: One of a teenybopping trio
of friendly neighborhood
something-or-others.

It looks like these three have
been hired by someone for some
kind of mission...but what?
---
11596: Paine
---
11597: One of a teenybopping trio
of friendly neighborhood
something-or-others.

They claim to come in peace...
but, really, what ARE they?
---
11598: Sora
---
11599: The hero of the Keyblade who
fights against the Heartless and
the Nobodies. His journey in
search of his lost friend Riku
continues.

Sora joined forces with the
Beast during his travels last
time, when the Beast was trying
to free Belle.
---
11600: Donald Duck
---
11601: The Royal Court Magician.

Donald left Disney Castle in the
Gummi Ship to search for King
Mickey.

Donald already knows the Beast.
The last time they met, they
fought together to free Belle
from her captors.
---
11602: Goofy
---
11603: Captain of the Royal Knights.

Goofy left Disney Castle in the
Gummi Ship to search for King
Mickey.

Goofy already knows the Beast.
The last time they met, they
fought together to free Belle
from her captors.
---
11604: The Beast
---
11605: A hideous beast with sharp teeth
and claws. A mysterious rose
is his most important possession,
kept in a glass case.

Sora and his friends helped the
Beast free Belle from Maleficent´s
clutches once before.
---
11606: The Beast
---
11607: A cold-hearted prince. Because
of his selfish heart, he was
changed into a beast by a
beautiful enchantress.

He was so ashamed of his
hideous appearance that he
turned his back on the world.
Meeting Belle softened his
heart and gave him hope for
the future.
---
11608: The Beast
---
11609: A spoiled and selfish prince. As
punishment for his cold heart, a
beautiful enchantress changed him
into a beast.

Unless he can learn to love and
earn love in return before the
last petal falls from the enchanted
rose, he´ll remain a beast forever.

When Belle came into his world,
he felt something change in him for
the first time in his life.
---
11610: Belle
---
11611: A girl who was held captive in the
Beast´s castle. At first he
frightened her, but little by
little, she noticed the injured
heart he was hiding from the
world.

Belle is one of the Seven
Princesses needed to open the
final door to the realm of darkness.
She´s very grateful to the Beast
and to Sora for saving her after
she was kidnapped by the Heartless.
---
11612: Belle
---
11613: Belle saw through the Beast´s
rough exterior and helped him
find the heart he´d been hiding
from the world for such a long
time. 

Belle loves to read books about
exciting adventures in faraway
places.
---
11614: Cogsworth
---
11615: The Beast´s majordomo. He became
a clock when an enchantress put
a spell on the castle. Cogsworth
is very particular about order
and punctuality. Maybe that´s
why he turned into a clock?
---
11616: Lumiere
---
11617: The castle´s maitre d´. He
became a candlestick when an
enchantress put a spell on the
castle. Lumiere has a way with
words and can be quite a charmer.
---
11618: Mrs. Potts
---
11619: The Beast´s housekeeper and
Chip´s mother. She became a
teapot when an enchantress put
a spell on the castle. Mrs. Potts
is always ready to warm your
heart with a comforting cup of
tea.
---
11620: Chip
---
11621: Mrs. Potts´s little boy. Chip
became a teacup when an

castle.

His missing front tooth became
a little chip on the rim of this
teacup.
---
11622: The Wardrobe
---
11623: The castle´s lady´s maid. She
became a wardrobe when an
enchantress put a spell on the
castle.
---
11624: Xaldin
---
11625: Organization {XIII}´s Number {III}.
His wiles have clouded the
Beast´s heart.

The Organization´s motives are
a string of mysteries--what
could their true goal be?
---
11626: Sora
---
11627: The hero of the Keyblade, whose
journey in search of Riku
continues.

Not long ago, he and Hercules
put the freeze on Hades´ plans
to take over the world. Phil has
dubbed him an honest-to-gods
"Junior Hero."
---
11628: Donald Duck
---
11629: The Royal Court Magician.
Donald and Goofy are traveling
with Sora because the King´s
letter told them to "follow
the Keybearer."

Not long ago, they helped Hercules
stop Hades from taking over the
world. Phil has dubbed him a
"Junior Hero."
---
11630: Goofy
---
11631: Captain of the Royal Knights.
Goofy and Donald are traveling
with Sora because the King´s
letter told them to "follow
the Keybearer."

Not long ago, they helped Hercules
stop Hades from taking over the
world. Phil has dubbed him a
"Junior Hero."
---
11632: Hercules
---
11633: A legendary hero with super
strength--and a pretty great
fellow, too. Hercules is the son
of the gods Zeus and Hera, but
he´s not a god himself. Not long
ago, he joined forces with Sora
and his friends to stop Hades from
taking over the world.

Hercules really impresses the
crowds when he battles in the
Coliseum. He´s never lost a
match yet.
---
11634: Hercules
---
11635: A legendary hero with super
strength. When the Hydra
destroyed the Coliseum,
Hercules thought he´d let
everyone down. Now he isn´t
sure he´s the hero he thought
he was, and he seems to have
lost his fighting spirit.
---
11636: Philoctetes
---
11637: Or "Phil" for short.
Phil is a veteran trainer of heroes
and Hercules´ mentor. He also
trained Sora and his friends during
their first adventures with
Hercules.

These days Phil is busy running
the Coliseum and screening
contestants for the games.
---
11638: Megara
---
11639: Or "Meg" for short. She´s
tough, witty, and a true friend
to Hercules. Since she met him,
Meg´s been trusting folks a
bit more than she did before.

Meg set out alone for the
Underworld. She knew Hercules
was exhausted and wanted Hades
to give him a break from fighting
in the Coliseum.
---
11640: Pegasus
---
11641: A beautiful horse that can fly
just like an eagle, Pegasus is
Hercules´ loyal partner. Hercules´
father Zeus created Pegasus from
a cloud and gave him to Hercules
when he was a baby.

Hercules and Pegasus were
separated for a while, but they
were reunited again when they grew
up.
---
11642: Auron
---
11643: A warrior that Hades called forth
from the Underworld.

In exchange for his freedom,
Auron was commanded to defeat
Hercules. But he refused to work
with Hades, saying, "This is my
story."

He doesn´t talk about himself very
much. What sort of story has he
written thus far?
---
11644: Pain
---
11645: One of Hades´ lackeys. Pain
tried to attack Hercules when
the great hero was a little baby,
but Hercules just clobbered him.

Pain can change form whenever
he likes, but he´s a bit of a
bumbler. He´s never far from
his evil partner Panic.
---
11646: Panic
---
11647: One of Hades´ lackeys. Panic
tried to attack Hercules when
the great hero was a little baby,
but Hercules just clobbered him.

Panic can change form whenever
he likes, but he´s a bit of a
bumbler. He´s never far from
his evil partner Pain.
---
11648: Hades
---
11649: Lord of the Underworld.

The last time Sora and his friends
tangled with Hades, he was using
the Heartless to try to take over
the world. Together with Hercules,
the three friends put a stop to
his plans. But Hades is as evil as
ever, and won´t rest until he
sends Hercules to the Underworld--
for eternity.
---
11650: Cerberus
---
11651: Guardian of the entrance to
the Underworld and Hades´
loyal "pet."

Hercules, Sora, Donald, and
Goofy teamed up to defeat
him last time, but Hades brought
him back--and he´s as
dangerous as ever.
---
11652: The Hydra
---
11653: A legendary monster
with many heads, sent
by Hades to fight
Hercules. If you cut
off one of its heads,
two more grow back.
---
11656: Demyx
---
11657: Organization {XIII}´s Number {IX}.

He was surveying the world of
Olympus, and even swiped the
Olympus Stone. He´s a lousy
fighter.

Demyx called Sora "Roxas."
---
11658: Sora
---
11659: The hero of the Keyblade who
fights against the Heartless and
the Nobodies. His journey in search
of Riku continues.

In his travels last time, he
helped stop Jafar from taking
over Agrabah by trapping him
inside a magic lamp.
---
11660: Donald Duck
---
11661: The Royal Court Magician. He´s

He´s traveling the worlds with

King.

The last time he visited Agrabah,
Goofy fought side by side with
Aladdin to defend the city from Jafar.
---
11664: Aladdin
---
11665: A young man from the desert
city of Agrabah. Not long ago,
Sora and his friends helped Aladdin
defeat Jafar and free Genie from
the lamp.

Aladdin used to worry that
someone known as a "street rat"
couldn´t really earn the love
of a princess. But Jasmine taught
Aladdin that it´s what´s inside
a person´s heart that really counts.

Aladdin´s friend Abu, the monkey,
is never far from his side.
---
11666: The Magic Carpet
---
11667: A magical flying carpet.

Carpet is an old friend of
Genie´s. Ever since Aladdin
found him in the Cave of
Wonders, Carpet will do
anything to help him. Carpet
can carry Aladdin across the
vastness of the desert in the
blink of an eye.
---
11668: Iago
---
11669: Jafar´s boisterous and cunning
parrot. He´s Jafar´s eyes and
ears for everything going on
in Agrabah.

Iago´s mischief finally landed
him inside the lamp, imprisoned
with Jafar. Now that he´s
finally free again, he swears
he´s turned over a new feather.
But I wonder...
---
11670: Abu
---
11671: Aladdin´s faithful and rather
furry sidekick. Abu doesn´t
talk a lot, but he always
understands what Aladdin needs.

Unfortunately, Abu can´t resist
treasure, even if it belongs
to somebody else.
---
11672: Princess Jasmine
---
11673: The princess of Agrabah and one
of the Seven Princesses needed
to open the door to the realm
of darkness.

Jasmine met Aladdin after she
fled the palace to try and lead
her own life. She´s very grateful
to Aladdin, Sora, and his friends
for saving her city from Jafar.
---
11674: Genie
---
11675: Genie spent ten thousand
years stuck inside the
magic lamp until Aladdin
found him. After Genie
helped Aladdin defeat
Jafar, Aladdin used his
third and final wish to
set Genie free.

For Genie, it´s a dream
come true. Instead of being
at every master´s beck and
call, he´s enjoying a carefree
life.
---
11676: Jafar
---
11677: Before he became an evil genie,
Jafar was the Sultan´s royal
vizier.

The last time we were in Agrabah,
Jafar was trying to use the
Heartless to take over the city.
He even got control of Aladdin´s
pal Genie and wished to become a
powerful genie himself. Aladdin,
Sora, and his friends joined
together to defeat Jafar, and
imprisoned him in his own lamp.
---
11678: Jafar
---
11679: When he was master of the
lamp, Jafar used his last
wish to become an all-
powerful genie. He was
imprisoned in the lamp, but
eventually made his escape,
thanks to the peddler.

Jafar then used his magical
power to grow to a colossal size.
He tried to take over Agrabah,
but Sora and his friends defeated
him once more.
---
11680: The Peddler
---
11681: He runs a shop offering all kinds of
merchandise. There´s definitely
something suspicious about this
fellow, though.
---
11682: Sora
---
11683: The hero of the Keyblade who
fights against the Heartless and
the Nobodies.

Sora continues to hunt for clues
to Riku´s whereabouts since the

11684: Donald Duck
---
11685: The Royal Court Magician. He left

whereabouts of King Mickey.
---
11686: Goofy
---
11687: Captain of the Royal Knights. He
left Disney Castle on a journey
to find the King, who had
disappeared.

Goofy´s loyalty to King Mickey
is second to none, and he´s
always ready to help his pal Sora
when the going gets tough.
---
11690: Ping
---
11691: The only daughter of the
distinguished Fa family. Her real
name is Fa Mulan.

She disguised herself as a man
and joined the Imperial Army in
her father´s place to fight
the Huns and uphold the family´s
honor. The other soldiers know
her as Ping.
---
11692: Mulan
---
11693: The only daughter of the
distinguished Fa family, Mulan
has a hard time acting the way
everybody wants her to. She´s
sure she´ll never fit in. But
when her aging father was ordered
to join the Imperial Army, she
sneaked away and risked her life
to take his place.
---
11694: Captain Li Shang
---
11695: A talented young officer whose
father is a distinguished general
in the Imperial Army.

Captain Shang has to train a
disorganized group of recruits
who´ve been drafted to help
fight the Huns. He sure is a
stickler for discipline, so he
must have his hands full getting
his inexperienced troops into shape.
---
11696: Yao
---
11697: One of the men drafted to help
defend China from the Hun
invasion.

Yao´s a compact sort of fellow
who likes to brag that he´s
tougher than anybody else.
---
11698: Chien-Po
---
11699: One of the men drafted to help
defend China from the Hun
invasion.

Chien-Po sure does love a good
meal. In fact, he´d probably
rather dream about food than
glory or adventure.
---
11700: Ling
---
11701: One of the men drafted to help
defend China from the Hun
invasion.

Ling loves to talk and tell jokes.
---
11702: The Emperor
---
11703: The Emperor rules China with
wisdom that´s said to be as
vast as the ocean, and with a
resolve that´s as unshakable
as a mountain.

He is deeply grateful to Mulan
and Captain Shang for saving
China from the Huns.
---
11704: Mushu
---
11705: He used to be one of the Fa
family guardians, but Mushu´s
mistakes got him demoted to the
lowly job of gong ringer. He
hopes to prove himself and win
back his place among the other
guardians by helping Mulan.

Mushu gave Sora and his friends
some valuable help during their
last adventure.
---
11706: Shan-Yu
---
11707: Leader of the Huns. He wants to
take over all of China.

Shan-Yu and his enormous army
are fearsome fighters who
have defeated some of the
Emperor´s best troops.
Now Shan-Yu plans to use
the Heartless to invade
the Empire.

Shan-Yu has fierce eyes,
and is always seen with a
hawk who serves as his eyes and
ears from above.
---
11710: Xigbar
---
11711: Organization {XIII}´s Number {II}.
When Sora called out to him,
thinking he was Riku, Xigbar gave
a curt reply.

His motives and his methods
remain unclear. Surely he has
a greater goal in mind, but what
could it be?
---
11712: Sora
---
11713: A boy who wields the Keyblade.

Not long ago, he gathered up the
scattered pages of a storybook
and became friends with everyone
inside.

is honey.

Pooh likes to exercise every
morning. He says it improves his
appetite.
---
11718: Tigger
---
11719: Tigger sure is energetic. He loves
to use his tail to bounce all over
the Hundred Acre Wood. Sometimes
his bouncing gets to be a bit
much, but he doesn´t mean any
harm. Underneath that happy-go-
lucky exterior, there´s a sensitive,
gentle heart.
---
11720: Piglet
---
11721: One of Pooh´s friends in the
Hundred Acre Wood.

Piglet´s tiny and startled by
just about anything. But
knowing he has friends like
Pooh always helps Piglet feel
a little more courageous.
---
11722: Eeyore
---
11723: Eeyore always seems to be a bit
gloomy. His usual residence is
a house built of sticks. His tail
is held on by a tack, but it keeps
falling off and getting lost.

Eeyore spends quite a lot of time
wandering the Hundred Acre Wood
looking for a new home, because
his stick house is always falling down.
---
11724: Owl
---
11725: Owl seems to be the wisest
resident of the Hundred Acre
Wood. Whenever anyone has a
question they can´t answer,
they ask Owl. He´s always
happy to help, but his answers
aren´t always exactly right!
---
11726: Kanga
---
11727: Roo´s mother. When she leaves

and gentle advice for her neighbors
in the Hundred Acre Wood.

Hundred Acre Wood. Roo looks
up to Tigger, and dreams of

That is, he´s a specialist at
digging holes. Whenever you need
to find him, just look for a mound
of fresh dirt.
---
11732: Sora
---
11733: A boy who fights with Keyblade
in hand, opening the way before
him as he searches for Riku and
a way home.

Sora has taken a feline form in
this world, but he seems to have
two left feet...four left paws?
Whatever.
---
11734: Donald Duck
---
11735: The Royal Court Magician. He´s
traveling the worlds with Sora
and Goofy in search of the King.

Donald´s got new wings in this

the hang of it right away.

---
11737: Captain of the Royal Knights.
He´s traveling the worlds with

---
11738: Pete
---
11739: Pete´s using the Heartless to
get control over all the worlds.

He´s helping Scar´s phantom,
too. Seems like Pete´s trying

---
11741: Son of the great Mufasa who
grew up to succeed his father
and rule the Pride Lands.

As a young cub, Simba mistakenly
thought he was responsible for
his father´s death. He left
the Pride Lands and met two
new friends: Timon and Pumbaa.
They taught him to lead a
carefree life.

During their first quest, Simba
helped Sora, Donald, and Goofy
whenever they called on him.
---
11744: Timon
---
11745: A meerkat and one of Simba's
closest pals. He found Simba,
almost dead of thirst, when he
was just a cub. Timon and his
best buddy Pumbaa taught Simba
their motto, hakuna matata,
which means "no worries."

And that's how Simba grew up--
with no worries, taking life
one day at a time.
---
11746: Pumbaa
---
11747: A warthog and one of Simba's
closest pals. He found Simba,
almost dead of thirst, when he
was just a cub. Pumbaa and his
best buddy Timon taught Simba
their motto, hakuna matata,
which means "no worries."

Some folks are a bit put off by
Pumbaa's pungency, but a kinder
fellow you'll never find.
---
11748: Nala
---
11749: Simba´s childhood friend Nala
has grown up to be a strong
lioness. She´s searching for
help to save the Pride Lands,

of Mufasa.

After Mufasa´s death and

and almost all the animals have
been forced to leave.

most beautiful singing voice of
all the merpeople.

grotto. Sora and his friends
helped her the last time Ursula
tried to take over Atlantica.
---
11776: Ariel
---
11777: The seventh daughter of Triton,
king of Atlantica. She made a
deal with Ursula to become a

If she doesn´t, she´ll become a
mermaid again and belong to Ursula.
---

11779: The Sea King who rules

---
11780: King Triton
---
11781: The Sea King who rules Atlantica.

ugly sea creature. But he was
willing to pay that price to
save Ariel from Ursula´s evil
magic.
---
11782: Sebastian
---
11783: King Triton´s court composer.
You could almost say he´s a

safe. Right now, he´s working on
a very special musical.
---
11784: Flounder

Triton, until her evil
scheming got her banished.

teeth.

mechanical specialists. He helps

Pete plans to destroy the
Cornerstone of Light. Without
the Cornerstone, Disney Castle
will be defenseless.
---
11820: Pete (?)
---
11821: Captain of a river steamboat;
this is a different Pete from
the one we know. He doesn´t
seem to have any connection
with the Heartless. Why, he
doesn´t even recognize Sora,
Donald, and Goofy!

I wonder if he´s just trying
to trick us.
---
11822: Horace Horsecollar

and people, it was turned
into a Heartless.
---
12044: Creeper
---
12045: The weakest of the Nobodies. It
takes on various shapes, making it
difficult to read its next move.

When it is paired with Dusk,
use Reversal to stop its
movements before attacking.
---
12046: Dusk
---
12047: It is difficult to read this creature´s
next move, so catch it off guard with
a Reversal to stop its actions. A
series of attacks and Reversals
can also look cool in battle!

Note: It lets its guard down when
its attack is parried. This is also
true for all Nobodies.
---
12048: Dragoon
---
12049: A dragoon. A high-ranking Nobody.
When a ball of light appears after
parrying its attacks, use Learn.
Time it accurately to use Jump
to attack.

Learn can be used as often as
possible, so a series of Jump
attacks is one strategy option.
---
12050: Assassin
---
12051: An assassin. A high-ranking Nobody.
It hides in the ground and attacks
quietly from behind.

It cannot be attacked while it is
in the ground. Parry its attacks
to get it to surface.

When it starts running around, look
out! It´ll begin to unleash powerful
attacks. Don´t miss any chances to
use the reaction commands to defeat
as many as possible at once!
---
12052: Samurai
---
12053: A samurai. A high-ranking Nobody.
Using swords and their sheaths as
weapons, it can handle up to four
weapons at a time. It attacks with
calmness and efficiency.

Make sure not to lose sight of it
once it hides beneath the ground.
After parrying its attack, it sits
and waits, giving an opportunity to
use reaction commands.

Fight one-on-one while the others
sit back and watch.
---
12054: Sniper
---
12055: A sniper. A high-ranking Nobody.
It is very agile as it moves around
defying gravity. Use magic to stop
its movements for an easier battle.

It attacks using arrows of light.
Ward them off with Warp Snipe.
Use this in succession for victory!
---
12056: Dancer
---
12057: A dancer. A high-ranking Nobody.
It skates around the ground and
quickly moves away when approached.
Wait for the end of its attack
to retaliate. When it approaches
with a low posture, look out!

If cornered, it retaliates with its
buddies, using kicks and other attacks.
Fight carefully when outnumbered.
---
12058: Berserker
---
12059: A berserker. A high-ranking
Nobody. Its attacks are hard
to read as it is dragged around
by a cursed hammer.

Attacks from the front will only
be parried by its hammer. Knock
it down to make it let go of the
hammer. Then pick up the
hammer to unleash a flurry
of attacks with Berserk.
---
12060: Gambler
---
12061: A gambler. A high-ranking Nobody.
It doesn´t seem to like fighting,
and just floats around aimlessly.

Use the reaction command when it
attacks with cards and dice, and
let the games begin!

Don´t lose, for something terrible
happens. Win for a chance to
attack--and maybe even for a
little something extra!
---
12062: Twilight Thorn
---
12063: A giant Nobody who Roxas fought
at the Station of Awakening.

Although it tried to capture
Roxas with its thorns, it was
overpowered and defeated by
the strength of
the Keyblade master.
---
12064: Paladin

13140: The Coliseum is in ruins, and Herc has
lost his will to fight. Best to let Meg
take care of him now.


---
13141: –––
---
13142: Hercules was sure he´d defeated the
Hydra, but it had revived somehow--
and now the Coliseum was in ruins.
Though we managed to get rid of the
beast for good, Herc lost his will
to fight. We were concerned, but
all we could do was trust Meg to
take good care of him.


---
13143: Auron recovers his free will, and Herc´s
feelings for Meg restore his strength. A
star is born!


---
13144: –––
---
13145: The door was connected to the past.
Sora and his friends kept Pete out of the
past to save the castle.


---
13146: –––

13147: The thief turns out to be the doctor´s
experiment, who only wanted a heart.
Sally shares her feelings with Jack.


---
13148: –––
---
13149: We recovered Auron´s heart, and
Herc´s feelings for Meg restored
his strength as well. We all worked
together to defeat Hades once and
for all, and our heroism was
commemorated in a constellation
that will shine brightly in the
night sky forevermore.


---
13150: The door was connected to the past.
Maleficent and Pete wanted to
change the past and make the castle
their own, but we put an end to
their devious plans, and the castle
was peaceful once more.


---
13151: The plan was a great success! We
caught the thief right away--and
it turned out to be the doctor´s
experiment. It had been searching
for a heart of its own in all the
wrapped presents. As the snow fell,
Jack received a precious gift from
Sally, who shared her feelings with
him.


---
13155: We arrived at the enemy´s stronghold--
their castle. Kairi had to be inside
somewhere.


---
13156: Search for Kairi!


---
13157: At last Sora found Kairi. We defeated
the Organization {XIII} member that
attacked, but Kairi was surrounded by
Heartless.


---
13158: Go save Kairi!


---
13159: Finally we were reunited with Kairi and
Riku. But the battle was far from over.
The King was still waiting.


---
13160: Head for the top of the castle!


---
13161: The contraption meant to absorb Kingdom
Hearts exploded. Kingdom Hearts had not
faded entirely. It was time for Xemnas
to pay.


---
13162: Defeat Xemnas, the last one standing!


---
13163: The door to Kingdom Hearts--the way to
Xemnas--had appeared. Would we find
victory, or simply cease to be? Once we
went in, there would be no going back...

---
13164: Go through the door to the final battle!
---
13165: We were on our way to the castle
when a man in a black coat blocked
our path. He was wielding a Keyblade
and bragging about how he´d defeated
Riku...but Sora was the only one who
saw him. "Tell me. Tell me why he
picked you!" he said, and after losing
his battle with Sora, disappeared--
looking somehow satisfied.


---
13166: Organization {XIII}´s Saïx was waiting
for us in the pitch-black castle,
and pointed at the moon in the night
sky. But that was no moon--it was
Kingdom Hearts, and it must have
absorbed countless hearts to grow to
that size. "The Organization doesn´t
need you anymore," Saïx scoffed, and
summoned masses of Heartless to do
Sora in.

That´s when we heard an old familiar
voice: Kairi! But there was no time to
celebrate, as the enemies kept coming in
droves. Kairi stepped in to end the battle
and rescue Sora. The one who had lent a
hand to Kairi was the false Ansem: Xehanort,
apprentice to Ansem the Wise. Sora was at
a loss...and then there was the fact that
Organization {XIII}´s Xigbar called him Roxas.
Defeating Xigbar, however, brought Sora no
closer to the truth.


---
13167: Sora finally pushed through the
throngs of Heartless and made his
way to Kairi. Watching over the two
as they embraced in joyous reunion
was Xehanort´s Heartless--Riku.
DiZ, who had observed the battle,
told the King his true identity. DiZ
was the real Ansem the Wise, and his
apprentice Xehanort´s Nobody was
Xemnas, leader of Organization {XIII}.
We had already defeated Xehanort´s
Heartless in battle once before,
when he went by the name "Ansem,
Seeker of Darkness." After his
defeat, however, he latched on to
Riku´s heart and began drawing him
into the darkness. Though Riku didn´t
give in to the darkness, he needed
to use its power. "Riku chose that
form so he could harness the power
of darkness." Everyone agreed with
Sora: "You´re still Riku, no matter
what!" If the battle was what was
keeping the power of darkness around,
it was time to finish that fight once
and for all.


---
13168: After taking on Luxord and Saïx,
we learned the truth about Roxas.
"Roxas...is your Nobody, Sora."
Roxas had been taken in by Xemnas
and made a member of Organization {XIII},
but, wanting to meet Sora, had
seemingly abandoned the shady group.
"I wish I could've met him too,"
muttered Sora; Riku pointed to Sora's
heart, indicating that Roxas was
within. Meanwhile, the King and Ansem
the Wise were using a device to try
to stop Kingdom Hearts, but it began
to malfunction. It seemed no one could
contain the power of hearts within the
massive Kingdom Hearts... Once Ansem
realized the truth about the human
heart, he decided to listen to what
his own heart was telling him. He
accepted his fate at the hands of the
device, which had run amok and was
going to explode. The explosion
scattered the hearts that had amassed
within Kingdom Hearts, raining them
down on us all. When the "heartshower"
had lifted, Riku had regained his
true form.


---
13169: Maleficent and Pete opened the path
to the final battle. They, too, had
chosen to do what their hearts
commanded, and no one could interfere
with their resolve. We joined 
together to battle Xemnas. When
we cornered him, he extracted the
power of Kingdom Hearts and vanished.
The worlds would be in great danger
if we just let him escape! A door
appeared in a brilliant flash of
light, just waiting for us. "The
worlds opened this path for us.
Looks like they´re dependin´
on us to make sure they stay safe."
With strong hearts, we went on to
fight our final battle, our dear
friends by our side.


---
13897: King Mickey
---
13898: It´s King Mickey, but back when
he was working on Pete´s steamboat.

One thing sure hasn´t changed--His
Majesty was just as brave back
then as he is now.
---
13903: Xaldin
---
13904: Organization {XIII}´s Number {III}.
He wanted the Beast´s Heartless
and Nobody in order to acquire
Kingdom Hearts.

In the end, however, Sora and
his friends destroyed Xaldin.
---
13931: Maleficent
---
13932: A sorceress of frightening power.
She´s using the Heartless as
part of her scheme to bring all
the worlds under her control.

Lock, Shock, and Barrel are just
what Maleficent needs to make
trouble for Sora and his friends
while they´re in Halloween Town.
---
13943: Tron
---
13944: A security program that was
improved and upgraded by Ansem
the Wise. He´s the fellow who
also reprogrammed the MCP. Tron
is dedicated to making sure the
system functions correctly, but
the MCP wants to take control
away from the users.

Only Ansem knows why these two
programs behave so differently.

14051: Secret Ansem Report 1

14052: 
My efforts these many years have come to
fruition, with the world I govern having
become a paradise worthy of being called
"Radiant Garden."

Nurtured by the pure water that is the
source of life, fragrant flowers bloom in
abundance, and the people face each day
with hopeful smiles.

But where there is light, darkness also
lurks.

As noted in my earlier reports, I must
solve the mystery of this "darkness of
the heart." This paradise depends on it.

I shall perform an experiment to probe the
depths of a person´s heart. One of my own
apprentices, Xehanort, has volunteered to
be a subject.

The young man has served me ever since I
nursed him back from death´s door some
years ago.

He had lost all his memories at the time,
but later showed remarkable intellectual
curiosity and readily absorbed my teachings,
gaining deep wisdom. Any mental immaturity
is surely due to his young age.

If I explore Xehanort´s heart with
psychological tests, I may be able to
recall the past locked away within. My
apprentice Even has also shown great
interest in Xehanort´s memories.

But is he really the right subject?
Xehanort does indeed exhibit extraordinary
talents...

Too extraordinary...
Perhaps they are even superhuman.

---
14053: Secret Ansem Report 2
---
14054: 
I have made a grave mistake.

My study of the "darkness of the heart"
began with a simple psychological test and
quickly snowballed.

Spurred on by my youngest apprentice
Ienzo, I constructed a massive laboratory
in the basement of my castle.

Unbeknownst to me, my six apprentices then
began collecting a large number of subjects
on which to perform dangerous experiments
into the "darkness of the heart."

As soon as I found out, I called my
apprentices together and ordered them
not only to cease their studies, but to
destroy the results of their research
thus far.

What on earth was happening within the
hearts of my six beloved apprentices?
While pursuing the mystery of the darkness
of the heart, could they themselves have
strayed into its depths?

Yet I remain the most foolish of all, for
having begun these experiments.

We are not meant to interfere in the
depths of another´s heart, no matter
what our reasons for doing so...

And my error plunged me into despair.

A visitor from another world soothed my
dejected soul.

A tiny king named Mickey came wielding a
legendary key--the infamous "Keyblade,"
said to bring both chaos and prosperity to
the world.

He was very knowledgeable on many topics,
and we deepened our friendship as we
conversed companionably.

Upon his advice, I decided to review the
data obtained at my basement lab.

That is when I discovered the "Ansem
Reports."

Though they bore my name, the only one
I had written was number 0.

Apparently he had gone on to pen
numbers 1 through 8 himself.

Yes--the first subject in my foolish
experiments.

---
14055: Secret Ansem Report 3
---
14056: 
Chaos affects not only this world, but
many other worlds besides.

In the "Ansem Reports" my apprentice
Xehanort had written under my name,
I found the records of his hideous
experiments along with his hypothesis
about the door that had appeared out
of the darkness in my basement.

All living things have hearts, and all
hearts hold darkness deep within.

Worlds are no exception. If a world
is a being, the heart it holds must
be colossal...

...and the darkness at its core must
be monstrous indeed.

Did Xehanort pass through that door in
an attempt to contact that dark realm?

No, not only Xehanort.

It appears my other five apprentices,
believing it was for the sake of research,
stared deep into the darkness and were
pulled into it.

Even, Ienzo, Braig, Dilan, and Aeleus...

They have ceased to be human.

I, too, have had everything taken away
from me, banished to a hollow realm of
nothingness.

What is Xehanort hoping to gain with my
pilfered existence?

Will my people cease to smile?

If the light of hope has been extinguished,
I shall henceforth walk with darkness as a
friend.

Here, in the realm of nothingness to which
I have been relegated.

Darkness in the midst of nothing.

"Darkness in Zero."

Thus, I shall be known as DiZ.

Discarding the stolen name "Ansem"...

And going in search of revenge.

---
14057: Secret Ansem Report 4
---
14058: 
The distant days spent in that beautiful
paradise are an illusion to me now.

How long have I been here, banished to
the realm of nothingness?

It is only by relying upon my anger and
hatred that I have been able to retain my
sense of self here, where all existence is
nullified.

My heart is being overcome with hatred
toward my apprentices, possessed by the
darkness, and with the anger I feel for
stupidly allowing myself to be betrayed.

Is this darkness, eating away at my heart?

I cannot continue to idle away my time
here.

What are Xehanort and the others
attempting to do?

I must unravel the mystery of these
Ansem Reports, intercept my apprentices,
and defeat them.

That is my mission...the only way to
repay the world for my sins.

Those beings who lack hearts--the
Heartless--must be the key.

The darkness of the heart, made flesh.
Cursed shadows who not only lack hearts,
but multiply by seizing hearts from any
and all living things.

Where have they come from, and where
are they going?

Three elements combine to create life:
a heart, a soul, and a body.

But what of the soul and body left
behind when the heart is lost?

When the soul leaves the body, its vessel,
life gives way to death, but what about
when the heart leaves?

A being does not perish when its heart
leaves its body. The heart alone
disappears into the darkness.

There is little time.

If I remain in this realm much longer, I
will certainly learn these answers the
hard way.

My heart is already a captive of the
darkness.

---
14059: Secret Ansem Report 5
---
14060: 
In this realm, where all existence has
been disintegrated, I have just barely
managed to preserve my sense of self
by continuing to think and to write.

It is a place where even time has lost
all meaning. Eternity is as but a
moment here.

I must make haste. Certainly their plans
are already underway.

The Heartless must be the key to
unraveling this mystery.

The six traitors were operating a
laboratory that churned out those cursed
shadows.

Not only did they generate "pureblood"
Heartless from living hearts, but they
then used those Heartless to synthesize
artificial versions of the creatures as
well.

These synthetic Heartless bore insignias
and were called "Emblems."

Pureblood or Emblem, these Heartless act
only to fulfill their instinctive needs.
They single-mindedly detect hearts and
swarm around them.

A human´s commands would be ineffective:
the Heartless would easily steal the
human´s heart and use it to increase
their own ranks.

But what if an even stronger Heartless
was giving the orders?

If he cast aside his own soul and body and
became a Heartless, wouldn´t he be able
to control the otherwise intractable
Heartless?

Furthermore, wouldn´t he be planning to
make use of the creatures´ instincts?
If the heart-seeking Heartless have their
sights set on a larger, more powerful
heart, their ultimate goal is crystal-
clear.

The largest heart in existence--the
heart of the world.

This is all conjecture, but it would seem
he is utilizing the Heartless in his search
for a path leading to the heart of the world.

---
14061: Secret Ansem Report 6
---
14062: 
My choice to befriend darkness here in the
midst of nothingness was a sound one.

The moment I stared straight ahead with a
calm heart, neither rejecting darkness nor
fearing it, I gained a newfound power.

A superhuman power--the power of
darkness.

It is likely Xehanort and the others were
enraptured by this power, eventually
becoming its prisoners.

I do not intend to allow my heart to be
devoured by the darkness as they did, of
course.

With this new power, I uncovered a
"corridor of darkness" that connects the
realm of nothingness to the outside world.
While it is still difficult to come and go
as I please, my banishment is now a thing
of the past.

To deceive Xehanort and my apprentices,
I first used my power to change form
before returning to the realm of light.

As I had suspected, Xehanort had become
a Heartless.

Under my name, he commanded other
Heartless in quests to snatch away the
hearts of many different worlds.

At the center of the hearts Xehanort
had stolen was "Kingdom Hearts,"
which attracts tremendous darkness to
itself and attempts to send any and
all matter back into its depths.

The other five have disappeared.
Have they become Heartless, like
Xehanort?

Or did they vanish after Xehanort
exploited them?

I became familiar with an unusual
"entity" while pursuing the truth.

It is the soul and body that remain
when a being loses its heart.

When a Heartless is born, these entities
disappear from the realm of light, to be
reborn as entirely new beings in a
completely different realm.

---
14063: Secret Ansem Report 7
---
14064: 
While beings born of darkness and those
lacking hearts may find them convenient,
it is dangerous for others to make much
use of the corridors of darkness.
Darkness erodes the heart.

In search of a place to proceed with my
research and planning away from prying
eyes, I found myself in "Twilight Town."
It is a quiet village, forgotten in the
chasm between light and darkness.
I situated myself in the basement of an
abandoned mansion standing beyond the
woods.

My underground research resulted in one
new discovery after another.

When a Heartless is born, the body and
soul left behind are reborn into this
world as a different being.

They possess different intentions than
their Heartless brethren, and while it is
unclear what these sentient "things" are
after, it would appear they are
responsible for much bedlam in the world.

My erstwhile friend the King and his
subjects, along with a hero wielding the
Keyblade, are battling the Heartless even
as a new threat approaches.

This new threat...they have given
themselves a fitting name, I suppose.

These non-beings: "Nobodies."

A great number of Nobodies have lost
human form, as have the Heartless.
Yet the Nobody born of someone with a
strong heart retains its shape, with but
the faintest visible changes.

It appears my betrayers have retained
their human forms as Nobodies, and are
gathering more followers in hopes of
furthering a new scheme.

"Organization {XIII}," formed of 13 Nobodies
with my betrayers at its core, has divided
into two; they are said to be carrying out
some sort of research.

Seeking to uncover the plans of this
Organization, I have decided to head for
where six of its members have gathered.
Towering over the outer limits of the
realm between darkness and light:
Castle Oblivion.

---
14065: Secret Ansem Report 8
---
14066: 
It appears that I have been too distracted
by the behavior of Xehanort and his
cohorts, and by the events occurring in
their vicinity.

My friends´ struggle to protect the realm
of light from the threat of Heartless is
now over, with Xehanort´s Heartless--
going by the name Ansem, Seeker of
Darkness--defeated at last.

The other wielder of the Keyblade, this
"hero," traveled from world to world
sealing up keyholes and laying Heartless
low.

Meanwhile, the King, who had dived into
the realm of darkness, worked with the
Keyblade-wielding hero to close the door
to Kingdom Hearts from the realms of
both darkness and light, thus holding
off the threat of tremendous darkness.

But there are still a great number of
Heartless afoot, and Organization {XIII} and
the Nobodies continue to be active in the
shadows.

Indeed, the world is still a very
dangerous place.

We must find a way to do battle with
these enemies.

Thus I will both make amends and have
my revenge.

It is for this reason that I infiltrated
Castle Oblivion.

It consists of 13 floors above and 12
floors below ground, with the contents of
its "White Rooms" transforming in
response to its visitors´ memories.
Organization {XIII} was conducting
experiments on memory here.

The subject in these experiments, a girl
named Naminé, appeared to possess
extremely unusual abilities.

Were they attempting to derive something
from these powers?

Refusing to be distracted by Organization
{XIII}, I had returned to my own secret
research when a new visitor appeared at
the castle today.

It was Sora, the Keyblade-wielding hero
who had defeated Ansem, and his
companions.

Deep underground, the stench of darkness
arose.

All the players are coming together, it
would seem.

---
14067: Secret Ansem Report 9
---
14068: 
I should have expected nothing less from a
Keyblade-wielding hero.

Sora and friends defied the machinations
of Organization {XIII} and rescued Naminé.

Naminé was a witch who controlled the
memories of others.

Most likely these powers were achieved
through a special process when she was
born.

Naminé is a Nobody, created when a young
girl's heart left her body.

Yet she has no corresponding Heartless.

This is because the "young girl" in this
case was a princess.

Kairi, a resident of Radiant Garden
over which I had ruled, was one of the
Seven Princesses that uphold the realm
of light.

With no darkness in her heart, Kairi
produced no Heartless, and instead of
vanishing, her body remained in the realm
of light.

In other words, both the Nobody called
Naminé and the Heartless--proof of a lost
heart--are extremely unstable beings who
lack the bodies needed to produce a Nobody.
Therefore, they also lack Kairi's memories.
One reason for this may be that Kairi's
heart did not return to the darkness when
separated from her body, but rather
migrated to another vessel...deep within
Sora's heart.

That is, Naminé is an alter ego of the
Kairi who has directly interfered with
Sora's heart. Could this be why Sora and
those whose hearts are connected to him
were able to have their memories
controlled?

She is a "non-being" in the truest sense
of the word; having not even become a
true Nobody and with nowhere left to go,
she is but the most fleeting of shadows.

---
14069: Secret Ansem Report 10
---
14070: 
Sora went to sleep in order to recover the
memories he lost in Castle Oblivion. It
would take quite some time to bring back
all the memories he had created in his
lifetime.

But Organization {XIII} held sway over Castle
Oblivion.

Sora would need to be kept someplace more
secure.

I persuaded Naminé to move the slumbering
Sora to Twilight Town for safekeeping.

Naminé.

As I have written here before, she is a
most unusual being.

Born of the same process as a Nobody,
but lacking virtually all the elements of
a Nobody.

Perhaps she continues drawing in hopes of
capturing that which she lacks: the
memories of others, especially Sora.

I have arrived at a hypothesis.

I believe that Naminé was born as a
special type of Nobody when Sora attacked
himself with the Keyblade, causing his and
Kairi´s hearts to leave their bodies
simultaneously.

Naminé emerged as Kairi´s Nobody...
but the body and soul necessary to exist
as a Nobody belonged to Sora.

When a person´s heart is stolen, a
Heartless is born with no sense of self,
and the body and soul left behind give
rise to a Nobody.

But what if one willingly releases one´s
heart from one´s body?

Sora and Xehanort retained their selfhood
even after becoming Heartless.

Then there are Kairi and Naminé.

Kairi was exceptional for having had no
darkness within her heart. Also
exceptional was that her heart, once
freed, migrated to a new vessel--
Sora.

The combination of these two theoretically
unlikely exceptions may be behind this
anomaly.

There are matters I must attend to
while Sora is sleeping.

A new ally has appeared on the scene:
Riku.

---
14072: ?????
---
14241: Reunion
---
14242: His journey over, Riku reunites with Sora
and Kairi, but has taken Ansem´s form
---
14243: What Will Happen?
---
14244: When Kingdom Hearts exploded, Riku
got his old look back
---
14245: The Final Door
---
14246: Xemnas, the last member of Organization
{XIII}, vanished through the final door
---
14254: Secret Ansem Report 11
---
14255: 
I was reunited with an old friend at
Castle Oblivion, but was unable to
disclose my identity.

If he knew the situation, he would likely
try to stop me from carrying out my
revenge.

As much as I would dearly love to converse
with him as in the old days...that is now
but a hopeless dream.

My friend has been fighting in the realm
of darkness. Most likely he found his way
there through Traverse Town.

Like Castle Oblivion, that village also
rests in the cleft between light and dark.
It consists of the remnants of worlds
whose hearts have been stolen by the
Heartless.

It is where those who have barely escaped
the destruction of their worlds eventually
find themselves.

This "realm between" is quite unstable,
with corridors of darkness appearing from
time to time.

Whenever a world disappears, some of its
inhabitants must arrive here through these
corridors.

Surely Sora traveled these same corridors
of darkness when he first came to Traverse
Town.

It seems my friend, fighting in the realm
of darkness, appeared in Castle Oblivion
through a corridor of darkness constructed
by Organization {XIII}.

My new ally Riku also effected his return
via one of these corridors.

He swore to me he would give his all for
his best friend, Sora.

In fact, Sora's memories have been slow
to return.

Thus I have asked Riku to bring me another
Sora--his Nobody.

Sora is indispensable if I am to achieve
my goal.

I require the Keyblade-wielding hero to
fly through the realm of light and defeat
Organization {XIII}.

---
14256: Secret Ansem Report 12
---
14257: 
Apart from Naminé, Nobodies retain their
memories of their time as humans,
but Sora´s Nobody, Roxas, has lost
Sora´s memories.

This is likely because Sora´s time as a
Heartless was short, having recovered his
heart and returned to his human form soon
after leaving behind Roxas, his Nobody.

It would seem Roxas is much like Naminé.
Naminé is Kairi´s Nobody, but came into
being via Sora´s body and soul.

Likewise, Roxas is Sora´s Nobody, but was
left behind because Sora´s Heartless
regained human form using Kairi´s heart
instead of his own.

It may be that Sora´s memories are slow
to return because the half of him that is
Roxas is still lacking.

I must convert Roxas into data and return
him to Sora.

As a member of Organization {XIII}, it was
exceedingly difficult to bring Roxas in.
Having lost to Roxas once, Riku laid
everything on the line and used the power
of darkness in their second battle, only
just managing to bring Roxas back with him.

But Organization {XIII} grows ever nearer.
Here, Twilight Town, is where Roxas was
reborn as a Nobody.

This is where Roxas first encountered
Organization {XIII} and joined its ranks.
They are bound to search this place
thoroughly.

First I shall convert all of Twilight Town
into data and construct a "world
duplicate" in Sora´s memories.
I shall place Roxas within that world to
live out his days and regain those
memories.

There is little time.

The Organization´s schemes must be
making steady progress as well.

---
14258: Secret Ansem Report 13
---
14259: 
Tomorrow Sora awakens.

My long and drawn-out revenge is nearing
its end.

Xehanort, who took everything away from me.
Though as a Heartless he is no more, as
the leader of Organization {XIII} his ambition
once again is to capture Kingdom Hearts,
the most colossal heart of all.

His Heartless had attempted to draw out
the great darkness of Kingdom Hearts,
created from the hearts of all worlds. His
Nobody, however, is now almost finished
gathering human hearts to be assimilated
into Kingdom Hearts as well.

The fool!

Only one mystery remains.

How did Xehanort manage to open the door
that appeared in the basement of my
castle...?

No...any theory posited now, when
everything is nearing completion, would be
meaningless.

Roxas, Ansem, Naminé...

They defy all logic, yet there they are:
singular exceptions to the rule.

The theories proposed by me and by
Organization {XIII} have been blown to pieces
by a handful of strong-hearted
individuals.

Sora, Kairi, Riku.

Ah, yes--Riku.

Though his heart had its weaknesses,
making it prone to darkness, he found
support in the hope he discovered beyond
suffering.

This hope allowed him to stand his ground
and turn the darkness in his heart from an
enemy into his greatest weapon.

When all this is over, it is my fervent
hope that he will be able to return with
Sora to his island.

If I can, I should like to return to
Radiant Garden, to look once more upon
the beautiful water, the lovely flowers,
and the hopeful smiles of the people.

Dear King, my friend!

I believe that, at some point in time, you
will come across these, my truthful
accounts.

How I wish I could have chatted with you
again.

I was a fool, obsessed with revenge.

Forgive me.

14621: Rabbit is proud of all the vegetables
he grows in his garden--especially
the carrots. Pooh likes visiting
Rabbit, as Rabbit always seems to
have some honey to share.

Rabbit is a very hard worker, and
he wishes Tigger wouldn´t bounce
so close to his prized carrots.
---
14627: Bolt Tower
---
14628: It has very high defense, and can
only take damage in the face.
Attack the face!

If caught by its snag laser, use
the reaction command Bolt
Reversal continuously to escape.
If successful, a big explosion will
unleash damage upon nearby
enemies.

14667: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

14756: Pete
---
14757: King Mickey´s nemesis. Pete is
collecting an army of Heartless
and helping Maleficent in her
scheme to take over all the
worlds. He´s also lending
Hades a hand with his collection
of Heartless.
---
14758: The Ghost of Scar
---
14759: This phantom appeared in the
Pride Lands after Scar´s
death. It seems to have been
created from the evil in Scar´s
heart, and it preys on the
weakness in Simba´s.

The ghost may be a sign of
more evil to come. Simba still
can´t seem to believe in
himself, and the other lions
are getting more and more worried.
---
14760: Undead Pirate A
---
14761: A pirate cursed by the Aztec
treasure. By moonlight, his
appearance is terrifying.
---
14762: Undead Pirate B
---
14763: A pirate cursed by the Aztec
treasure. By moonlight, he
becomes a skeleton and is
vulnerable to magic attacks.
---
14764: Undead Pirate C
---
14765: A pirate cursed by the Aztec
treasure. He and Captain
Barbossa are searching for
something that will break the
curse.
---
14766: King Mickey
---
14767: The King of Disney Castle. He
faced incredible danger as he
sought out the secrets of
Organization {XIII} on his own.

The King seems to know
something about what happened
to Riku. Whatever it is, he´s
keeping it to himself.
---
14768: Ansem the Wise
---
14769: The man who called himself
"DiZ" and dressed his face in
bandages to conceal it, now
revealed to be none other than
Ansem the Wise.

The true Ansem once studied
hearts and the Heartless, but
soon ceased his research for
fear of disrupting the order
of the worlds. But his
apprentice Xehanort betrayed
him, robbing Ansem of his
discoveries and his pride.

Since that time, Ansem was
driven by vengeance--but when
he saw Riku go so far as to
give up his physical form to
help his friend Sora, he had
a change of heart.
---
14773: Riku
---
14774: Sora´s longtime friend. He had
clad himself in darkness in
order to wield it, and had
even changed in appearance.

But when the real Ansem´s
Kingdom Hearts Encoder
exploded, Riku returned to his
own form.

You could say it was a miracle--
worked by a heart no darkness
could eclipse.
---
14775: Xemnas
---
14776: Organization {XIII}´s Number {I}.
He directs the group as its
leader.

In truth, he is the Nobody of
Xehanort, who was apprenticed
to Ansem the Wise. In secret,
Xehanort studied the doors
and the heart of all worlds,
ultimately stealing his master´s
name, Ansem. When Xehanort
became a Heartless, his Nobody
Xemnas came into being.

Xemnas is using Sora, collecting
the hearts released every time
a Heartless falls to his
Keyblade.
---
14777: Xigbar
---
14778: Organization {XIII}´s Number {II}.
When Sora called out to him,
thinking he was Riku, Xigbar gave
a curt reply.

His motives and his methods
remain unclear. Surely he has
a greater goal in mind, but what
could it be?
---
14779: Xaldin
---
14780: Organization {XIII}´s Number {III}.
He sought the Beast´s Heartless
and Nobody in order to acquire
Kingdom Hearts.

He was a master of wind who
wielded six lances--but he met
his end at the hands of Sora.
---
14781: Demyx
---
14782: Organization {XIII}´s Number {IX}.
He used a type of instrument
called a "sitar" to control
water...but he wasn´t very
good at fighting.

Demyx was under orders to
"liberate Sora´s true disposition"
while surveying the world of
Olympus.
---
14783: Luxord
---
14784: Organization {XIII}´s Number {X},
a gambler who can manipulate
time.

Having shaken Sora and his
companions with wily words,
Luxord entertained himself by
drawing them into a game-like
battle.

In Port Royal, Luxord used
Heartless and the cursed
medallions to conduct
experiments on the
Organization´s behalf and
collect hearts.
---
14785: Pete
---
14786: Pete´s been a thorn in King
Mickey´s side ever since the
days the King served on Pete´s
steamboat.

Now Pete´s teamed up with
Captain Barbossa and his men.
He´s planning something bad--
that much is certain.
---
14787: Ansem the Wise
---
14788: The man who called himself
"DiZ" and dressed his face in
bandages to conceal it, now
revealed to be none other than
Ansem the Wise.

The true Ansem once studied
hearts and the Heartless, but
soon ceased his research for
fear of disrupting the order
of the worlds. But his
apprentice Xehanort betrayed
him, robbing Ansem of his
discoveries and his pride.

Since that time, Ansem was
driven by vengeance--but when
he saw Riku go so far as to
give up his physical form to
help his friend Sora, he had
a change of heart.
---
14789: Moogles
---
14790: A strange race that pops up in
even stranger places to open
shop.

Moogles hate having their pompoms
ruffled (don´t we all?), but the
pompom rufflers just keep coming
in droves. Maybe that´s why the
moogles use holograms to run their
shops now, while they kick back
at home.
---
14832: Sorcerer
---
14833: A sorcerer. A high-ranking Nobody.
Immune to magic, it attacks with
invulnerable cubes.

Watch out for the cubes while
attacking the main body. The cubes
disappear when the body is defeated.
---
17244: Pete
---
17245: Captain of a river steamboat.
He´s Pete, but from the past.
A long time ago, King Mickey
started out working for Pete
on his boat.

Somehow, Pete´s managed to get
his boat stolen by himself--
that is, by the Pete from the
future!
---
17246: Maleficent
---
17247: A sorceress of frightening power
who´s behind the strange goings-
on at Disney Castle.

Maleficent is determined to take
over Disney Castle, and she´s
using the power of darkness in
her evil scheme.
---
17248: Bathtub
---
17249: The walking bathtub Lock, Shock,
and Barrel use to get around.
It´s also big enough to carry
any mischief-making tools they
need to bring along.
---
17250: Luxord
---
17251: Organization {XIII}´s Number {X}, a
master of rhetoric whose words
left Sora and his companions
quite perplexed.

Luxord was using the cursed
medallions to conduct experiments
on behalf of the Organization.
---
17285: Kairi had appeared in Twilight Town, but
Axel took off with her. We set off once
more, believing that our path will lead
us to them one day.
---
17286: Set sail for the next world!
---
17287: We found the entrance to the dark realm
in the basement hall. We´re on the verge
of heading into the enemy´s stronghold!
---
17288: Dive into the darkness!
---
17289: Axel used the last of his power to
open a passageway to the darkness.
Kairi waited within...

---
17290: –––
---
17291: Kairi had come to Twilight Town in
search of Sora, but then Axel kidnapped
her. "I gotta help Kairi!" Sora exclaimed.
Just then the crystal from Seifer´s trophy
began to glow, and a new road was opened.
Surely this road led to Kairi and Riku--
and so believing, Sora and friends were
on their way to find them.


---
17292: The entrance was an eerie gaping hole
in the basement hall of the old mansion.


---
17293: Sora and his friends headed into the
darkness, but were beset by enemies
on all sides. Axel was the one who got
them out of their predicament. He
apologized for kidnapping Kairi and put
everything he had into wiping out the
marauding foes. When Sora asked why,
Axel muttered, "I just wanted to see
Roxas again. He made me feel like I had
a heart," before fading away. Though it
had cost him his life, Axel had used
every last drop of his strength to open
the final path Sora had to follow--the
path that led to the kidnapped Kairi.


---
17923: Kairi
---
17924: Longtime friend of Riku and Sora,
and one of the Seven Princesses
with ties to the Keys and Keyholes.

She had lost her memories of Sora,
and after they returned, she wanted
to see him more and more with every
passing day.

Falling through an unexpected hole
in the darkness, she arrived in
Twilight Town and befriended Hayner,
Pence, and Olette before being
captured by Axel.

Kairi is fervently hoping to meet
up with Sora once more.
---
17943: Saïx
---
17944: Organization {XIII}´s Number {VII}.

He was in pursuit of the
renegade Axel, but for some
reason seemed more concerned
about Sora´s well-being.

Saïx has no heart, but knows
all too well how to injure one.
No doubt his poise belies a more
savage nature. He also insinuated
he knew something about Riku.
---
18041: Xehanort
---
18042: The former apprentice of Ansem
the Wise.

Even after becoming a Heartless,
Xehanort persisted in his
research of the doors and the
heart of all worlds--all in
the name of "Ansem," of
course.

Meanwhile, his Nobody, Xemnas,
had taken leadership of
Organization {XIII}.
---
18246: We need money to get to the beach.
All Hayner would say is "Leave
it to me!" before he ran off toward
Market Street.
---
18247: Head for Market Street!
---
18248: Hayner´s plan was for everyone to
earn munny for the beach by doing
odd jobs.
---
18249: Meet at the station with some munny!
---
18250: Hayner´s plan was for everyone to
earn munny for the beach by doing
odd jobs.
---
18251: Get to the ticket booth!
---
18252: On my way to the station, I ran
into a mysterious girl. "I wanted
to meet you at least once," she
said, before heading off toward
the haunted mansion.
---
18253: Go check out the old mansion!
---
18254: I was surrounded by monsters when I
heard the girl´s voice telling me to use
the Keyblade. That´s when I found myself
in an unfamiliar place, bathed in light.
---
18255: Choose the one you want!
---
18256: When I defeated the shady creatures
with the Keyblade, a treasure chest
appeared.
---
18257: Try opening the treasure chest!
---
18258: After I opened the treasure chest, a
huge door appeared out of thin air.
---
18259: Keep going!
---
18260: Hayner and I are on speaking terms, at
least, but what happened yesterday has
kind of soured things between us. Still,
the tournament is about to begin.
---
18261: Review the tournament rules!
---
18262: After reviewing the tournament
rules, the first round was underway.
---
18263: Struggle time: talk to the promoter!
---
18264: I beat Hayner and advanced to the
next round, but something about my
opponent Vivi seemed a little off.
---
18265: The finals: talk to the promoter!
---
18266: Despite being tied up in some bizarre
goings-on, I somehow managed to win
the tournament. Now I get to face the
champion!
---
18267: The title bout: see the promoter!
---
18268: We went to Sunset Station in the
terrace to get started on our
research of the seven wonders.
---
18269: Head for Sunset Station!
---
18270: There wasn´t much to the mysterious
stone steps after all, so we started
investigating the rest of the seven
wonders in the terrace.
---
18271: Investigate the seven wonders!
---
18272: To get to the bottom of our next
Wonder, the Ghost Train Mystery,
we set out for Sunset Hill.
---
18273: Head for Sunset Hill!
---
18274: My friends didn´t want any part of it,
so I went to check out the last of
the seven wonders--the haunted
mansion--alone.
---
18275: Go over to the old mansion!
---
18276: When I got back from the haunted
mansion, Olette suggested we go
see Hayner at the station. We
had only two more days left in
our summer vacation...
---
18277: Go to the station to meet up with
Hayner!
---
18278: The town seemed different somehow, too.
I was fighting with Axel, who had shown
up again, when I heard a voice: "Roxas,
to the mansion!"
---
18279: Head for the old mansion!
---
18280: The enemies threatened to drive me into
a corner, but I relied on the memories
that were coming back to me and used
the Keyblade to unlock the gate.
---
18281: Find out whose voice that is!
---
18282: I reunited with Naminé in the old mansion,
but she was taken away by a mysterious
man all wrapped up in bandages. Where
could they have gone?
---
18283: Check the mansion for clues!
---
18284: I searched the mansion and
discovered a way into a secret room
from the library.
---
18285: Check out the basement!
---
18286: My lost memories began to return
while I was in the computer room.
---
18287: Go deep into the mansion!
---
18288: Axel picked a fight with me, but I
defeated him. "Let´s meet again in the
next life," Axel said as he vanished
into a dark hole.
---
18289: Go even deeper into the mansion!
---
18290: Donald and Goofy were sleeping
peacefully inside their pods. A
door there led even further in...
---
18291: Go into the mansion´s deepest core!
---

with his back to the pods.
---
18316: Go toward the man...
---
18317: 


---
18400: Graveyard
---
18401: It boldly approaches its target,
but catch it off guard after it
attacks.

It summons persistent ghouls
when it turns into a headstone.
Defeat it before it has a
chance to call forth these
annoying ghouls.
